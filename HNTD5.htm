<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>I was still in medical school when I got a call
to help defend Oprah Winfrey, who was being sued by a cattle rancher under a
Texas food-disparagement law (thirteen states have so-called food-libel laws
that make it illegal to make a comment that unfairly “implies that [a]
perishable food product is not safe for consumption by the public”<a
href="part0049.html#chapter5-1">1</a>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Oprah had been talking on her television show
with Howard Lyman, a former fourth-generation cattle rancher who decried the cannibalistic
feeding of cow parts to other cows, a risky practice blamed for the emergence
and spread of mad cow disease. Repulsed by the thought, Oprah told the viewing
audience, “It has just stopped me cold from eating another burger.” The next
day, cattle futures tumbled, and the Texas cattleman claimed to have lost
millions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>My job was to help establish that Lyman’s
comments were “based on reasonable and reliable scientific inquiry, facts, or
data.”<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-2">2</a> Despite the ease with which we
did just that, not to mention the blatant violation of First Amendment
protections inherent in the law, the Texas cattleman was able to tie Oprah up
in a long and harrowing appeals process. Finally, five years later, a federal
judge dismissed the case with prejudice, ending Oprah’s ordeal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In a narrow legal sense, she won. But if the
meat industry is able to drag one of the country’s richest and most powerful
people through the courts for years and cost her a small fortune in legal fees,
what kind of chilling effect does that have on others who want to speak out?
Now the meat industry is trying to pass so-called ag-gag laws, which make it
illegal to take pictures inside their operations. Presumably, they fear people
might be less inclined to buy their products if they knew how these products
are made.<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-3">3</a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Thankfully, humanity dodged a bullet with mad
cow disease. Nearly an entire generation in Britain was exposed to infected
beef, but only a few hundred people died. We weren’t as lucky with swine flu,
which the CDC estimates killed twelve thousand Americans.<a
href="part0049.html#chapter5-4">4</a> Nearly three-quarters of all emerging and
reemerging human diseases arise from the animal kingdom.<a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Humanity’s dominion over animals has unleashed
a veritable Pandora’s ark of infectious diseases. Most modern human infectious
diseases were unknown before domestication led to a mass spillover of animal
disease into human populations.<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-6">6</a> For
example, tuberculosis appears to have been originally acquired through the
domestication of goats<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-7">7</a> but now infects
nearly one-third of humanity.<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-8">8</a>
Meanwhile, measles<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-9">9</a> and smallpox<a
href="part0049.html#chapter5-10">10</a> may have arisen from mutant cattle
viruses. We domesticated pigs and got whooping cough, we domesticated chickens
and got typhoid fever, and we domesticated ducks and got influenza.<a
href="part0049.html#chapter5-11">11</a> Leprosy may have come from water
buffalo and the cold virus from horses.<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-12">12</a>
How often did wild horses have the opportunity to sneeze into humans’ faces
until they were broken and bridled? Before then, the common cold was presumably
common only to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Once pathogens jump the species barrier, they
can then transmit person-to-person. HIV, a virus thought to have originated
from the butchering of primates in Africa for the bush-meat trade,<a
href="part0049.html#chapter5-13">13</a> causes AIDS by weakening the immune
system. The opportunistic fungal, viral, and bacterial infections AIDS patients
contract—but to which healthy people are resistant—demonstrate the importance
of baseline immune function. Your immune system is not just active when you’re
lying in bed sick spiking a fever—it’s involved in a daily life-or-death
struggle to save your life from the pathogens that surround and live inside
you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>With every breath you take, you inhale
thousands of bacteria,<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-14">14</a> and with every
bite you eat, you can ingest millions more.<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-15">15</a>
Most of these tiny germs are completely harmless, but some can cause serious
infectious diseases, occasionally making headlines with sinister-sounding names
like SARS or Ebola. Although many of these exotic pathogens receive a lot of
press coverage, more lives are lost to some of our most common infections. For
example, such respiratory infections as influenza and pneumonia kill nearly
fifty-seven thousand Americans each year.<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-16">16</a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Bear in mind that you don’t need to come in
contact with a sick person to fall ill with an infection. There are latent
infections that may exist within you, waiting to strike should your immune
function falter. That is why it’s not enough to just wash your hands; you have
to keep your immune system healthy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>To protect others when you’re sick, you need to
practice good respiratory etiquette by coughing or sneezing into the crook of
your arm (into your bent elbow). This practice limits the dispersal of
respiratory droplets and also avoids contaminating your hands. The Mayo Clinic
has a slogan worth remembering: “The ten worst sources of contagion are our
fingers.” When you cough into your hand, you can transfer contagion to
everything from elevator buttons and light switches to gas pumps and toilet
handles.<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-17">17</a> It’s no surprise that during
flu season, the influenza virus can be found on more than 50 percent of common
household and day-care-center surfaces.<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-18">18</a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Ideally, you should sanitize your hands after
every bathroom visit and handshake, before all food preparation, and before
touching your eyes, nose, or mouth after coming in contact with public
surfaces. The latest recommendations from the World Health Organization favor
the use of alcohol-based sanitizing rubs or gels over hand washing for routine
disinfection of your hands throughout the day. (Products containing between 60
and 80 percent alcohol were found to be more effective than soap in every
scientific study available for review.) The only time hand washing is
preferable is when they are dirty or visibly contaminated with bodily fluids.
For routine decontamination—that is, for all other times—alcohol-based products
are the preferred method for hand sanitation.<a href="part0049.html#chapter5-19">19</a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Still, some germs will always get past your
first line of defense of practicing good hand hygiene. This is why you need to
keep your immune system functioning at peak performance with a healthy diet and
lifestyle.</span></p>

DISEASES WITH A HEALTHY IMMUNE SYSTEM</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The term “immune system” is derived from the
Latin word immunis, meaning untaxed or untouched, which is fitting, given that
the immune system protects the body from foreign invaders. Composed of various
organs, white blood cells, and proteins called antibodies that form alliances
against trespassing pathogens threatening the body, the immune system, apart
from the nervous system, is the most complex organ system humans possess.<a
href="part0049.html#chapter5-20">20</a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Your first layer of protection against
intruders are physical surface barriers like your skin. Beneath that are white
blood cells, such as neutrophils that attack and engulf pathogens directly, and
natural killer cells that put your cells out of their misery if they become
cancerous or infected with a virus. How do natural killer cells recognize
pathogens and infected cells? They are often marked for destruction by
antibodies, which are special proteins made by another type of white blood
cell, known as B cells, that home in like smart bombs and stick to invaders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Each B cell makes one type of antibody that’s
specific for one foreign molecular signature. You don’t have one B cell that
covers grass pollen and another that covers bacteria; instead, you have a B cell
whose only job is to make antibodies against the pollen of purple Siberian
onion grass and another whose only job is to make antibodies against the tail
proteins of bacteria that live in the thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean.
If each of your B cells produces only one type of antibody, then you’d need to
have a billion different types of B cells given the incredible variety of
potential pathogens on our planet. And you do!</span></p>
