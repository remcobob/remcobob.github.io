of terrorist: fatty deposits in the walls of your arteries called
atherosclerotic plaque. For most Americans raised on a conventional diet,
plaque accumulates inside the coronary arteries—the blood vessels that crown
the heart (hence “coronary”) and supply it with oxygen-rich blood. This buildup
of plaque, known as atherosclerosis, from the Greek words <span class=SpellE>athere</span>
(gruel) and <span class=SpellE>sklerosis</span> (hardening), is the hardening
of the arteries by pockets of cholesterol-rich gunk that builds up within the
inner linings of the blood vessels. This process occurs over decades, slowly
bulging into the space inside the arteries, narrowing the path for blood to
flow. The restriction of blood circulation to the heart muscle can lead to chest
pain and pressure, known as angina, when people try to exert themselves. If the
plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form within the artery. This sudden blockage
of blood flow can cause a heart attack, damaging or even killing part of the
heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

disease, the very first symptom may be their last.1 It’s called “sudden cardiac
death.” This is when death occurs within an hour of symptom onset. In other

be feeling perfectly fine one moment, and then an hour later, you’re gone

enormous swaths of the world where the epidemic of coronary heart disease
simply didn’t exist. For instance, in the famous China-Cornell-Oxford Project
(known as the China Study), researchers investigated the eating habits and
incidence of chronic disease among hundreds of thousands of rural Chinese. In
Guizhou province, for example, a region comprising half a million people, over

populations in the so-called developed world were largely absent across most of
the continent. In Uganda, a country of millions in eastern Africa, coronary

dying early of other diseases, never living long enough to come down with heart
disease? No. The doctors compared autopsies of Ugandans to autopsies of
Americans who had died at the same age. The researchers found that out of 632
people autopsied in Saint Louis, Missouri, there had been 136 heart attacks.
But in 632 age-matched Ugandans? A single heart <span class=GramE>attack</span>.
The Ugandans experienced more than one hundred times fewer heart attacks than
the Americans. The doctors were so blown away that they examined another 800
deaths in Uganda. Out of more than 1,400 Ugandans autopsied, researchers found
just one body with a small, healed lesion of the heart, meaning the attack
wasn’t even fatal. Then and now, in the industrialized world, heart disease is
a leading killer. In central Africa, heart disease was so rare it killed fewer
than one in a thousand.4<o:p></o:p></span></p>

heart disease is not just something in the Africans’ genes. When people move
from low-risk to high-risk areas, their disease rates skyrocket as they adopt
the diet and lifestyle habits of their new homes.5 The extraordinarily low
rates of heart disease in rural China and Africa have been attributed to the
extraordinarily low cholesterol levels among these populations. Though Chinese
and African diets are very different, they share commonalities: They are both
centered on plant-derived foods, such as grains and vegetables. By eating so

cardiac death, sudden death, heart attack, and stroke. These included studies

DART trial from the 1980s involving two thousand men found that those advised
to eat fatty fish had a 29 percent reduction in mortality.15 That’s impressive,
so it’s no wonder the study got a lot of attention. But people seem to have
forgotten about the sequel, the DART-2 trial, which found the exact opposite.
Run by the same group of researchers, the DART-2 trial was an even bigger
