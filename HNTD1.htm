Disease</a></span></p>

<p class=tni><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Imagine if terrorists
created a bioagent that spread mercilessly, claiming the lives of nearly four
hundred thousand Americans every year. That is the equivalent of one person
every eighty-three seconds, every hour, around the clock, year after year. The
pandemic would be front-page news all day, every day. We’d marshal the army and
march our finest medical minds into a room to figure out a cure for this
bioterror plague. In short, we’d stop at nothing until the terrorists were
stopped.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Fortunately, we’re not
actually losing hundreds of thousands of people each year to a preventable
threat&nbsp;… are we?</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Actually, we are. This
particular biological weapon may not be a germ released by terrorists, but it
kills more Americans <span class=epub-i1>annually</span> than have all our past
wars combined. It can be stopped not in a laboratory but right in our grocery
stores, kitchens, and dining rooms. As far as weapons go, we don’t need
vaccines or antibiotics. A simple fork will do.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>So what’s going on
here? If this epidemic is present on such a massive scale, yet so preventable,
why aren’t we doing more about it?</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The killer I’m talking
about is coronary heart disease, and it’s affecting nearly everyone raised on
the standard American diet.</span></p>

<p class=h align=center style='text-align:center'><span class=epub-b1><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Our Top Killer</span></span></p>

<p class=tni><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>America’s number-one
killer is a different kind of terrorist: fatty deposits in the walls of your
arteries called atherosclerotic plaque. For most Americans raised on a
conventional diet, plaque accumulates inside the coronary arteries—the blood
vessels that crown the heart (hence “coronary”) and supply it with oxygen-rich
blood. This buildup of plaque, known as atherosclerosis, from the Greek words <span
class=epub-i1>athere</span> (gruel) and <span class=epub-i1>sklerosis</span>
(hardening), is the hardening of the arteries by pockets of cholesterol-rich
gunk that builds up within the inner linings of the blood vessels. This process
occurs over decades, slowly bulging into the space inside the arteries,
narrowing the path for blood to flow. The restriction of blood circulation to
the heart muscle can lead to chest pain and pressure, known as angina, when
people try to exert themselves. If the plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form
within the artery. This sudden blockage of blood flow can cause a heart attack,
damaging or even killing part of the heart.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>When you think about
heart disease, you may think of friends or loved ones who suffered for years
with chest pain and shortness of breath before they finally succumbed. However,
for the majority of Americans who die suddenly from heart disease, the very
first symptom may be their last.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0043.html#chapter1-1" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-1>1</a></span> It’s
called “sudden cardiac death.” This is when death occurs within an hour of
symptom onset. In other words, you may not even realize you’re at risk until
it’s too late. You could be feeling perfectly fine one moment, and then an hour
later, you’re gone forever. That’s why it’s critical to prevent heart disease
in the first place, before you even necessarily know you have it.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>My patients often
asked me, “Isn’t heart disease just a consequence of getting old?” I can see
why this is a common misconception. After all, your heart pumps literally
billions of times during the average life span. Does your ticker just conk out
after a while? No.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>A large body of
evidence shows there were once enormous swaths of the world where the epidemic
of coronary heart disease simply didn’t exist. For instance, in the famous
China-Cornell-Oxford Project (known as the China Study), researchers
investigated the eating habits and incidence of chronic disease among hundreds
of thousands of rural Chinese. In Guizhou province, for example, a region
comprising half a million people, over the course of three years, not a single
death could be attributed to coronary artery disease among men under sixty-five.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0043.html#chapter1-2" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-2>2</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>During the 1930s and
1940s, Western-trained doctors working throughout an extensive network of
missionary hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa noticed that many of the chronic
diseases laying waste to populations in the so-called developed world were
largely absent across most of the continent. In Uganda, a country of millions
in eastern Africa, coronary heart disease was described as “almost
non-existent.”<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0043.html#chapter1-3"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-3>3</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>But were the people of
these nations simply dying early of other diseases, never living long enough to
come down with heart disease? No. The doctors compared autopsies of Ugandans to
autopsies of Americans who had died at the same age. The researchers found that
out of 632 people autopsied in Saint Louis, Missouri, there had been 136 heart
attacks. But in 632 age-matched Ugandans? A single heart attack. The Ugandans
experienced more than one hundred times fewer heart attacks than the Americans.
The doctors were so blown away that they examined another 800 deaths in Uganda.
Out of more than 1,400 Ugandans autopsied, researchers found just one body with
a small, healed lesion of the heart, meaning the attack wasn’t even fatal. Then
and now, in the industrialized world, heart disease is a leading killer. In
central Africa, heart disease was so rare it killed fewer than one in a
thousand.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0043.html#chapter1-4"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-4>4</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Immigration studies
show that this resistance to heart disease is not just something in the
Africans’ genes. When people move from low-risk to high-risk areas, their
disease rates skyrocket as they adopt the diet and lifestyle habits of their
new homes.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0043.html#chapter1-5"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-5>5</a></span> The extraordinarily low rates of
heart disease in rural China and Africa have been attributed to the
extraordinarily low cholesterol levels among these populations. Though Chinese
and African diets are very different, they share commonalities: They are both
centered on plant-derived foods, such as grains and vegetables. By eating so
much fiber and so little animal fat, their total cholesterol levels averaged
under 150 mg/dL,<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0043.html#chapter1-6"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-6>6</a>,<a href="part0043.html#chapter1-7"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-7>7</a></span> similar to people who eat
contemporary plant-based diets.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0043.html#chapter1-8" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-8>8</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>So what does all of
this mean? It means heart disease may be a choice.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>If you looked at the
teeth of people who lived more than ten thousand years before the invention of
the toothbrush, you’d notice they had almost no cavities.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0043.html#chapter1-9" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-9>9</a></span> They never flossed a day in their lives, yet no cavities.
That’s because candy bars hadn’t been invented yet. The reason people get
cavities now is that the pleasure they derive from sugary treats may outweigh
the cost and discomfort of the dentist’s chair. I certainly enjoy the
occasional indulgence—I’ve got a good dental plan! But what if instead of the
dental plaque on our teeth, we’re talking about the atherosclerotic plaque
building up in our arteries? We’re not just talking about scraping tartar
anymore. We’re talking about life and death.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Heart disease is the
number-one reason we and most of our loved ones will die. Of course, it’s up to
each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how to live, but
shouldn’t we try to make these choices consciously by educating ourselves about
the predictable consequences of our actions? Just as we could avoid sugary
foods that rot our teeth, we can avoid the trans fat, saturated fat, and
cholesterol-laden foods that clog up our arteries.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Let’s take a look at
the progression of coronary heart disease throughout life and learn how simple
dietary choices at any stage may prevent, stop, and even reverse heart disease
before it’s too late.</span></p>
