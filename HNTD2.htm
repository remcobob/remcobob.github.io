Not to Die from Lung Diseases</a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The worst death I ever witnessed was that of a
man dying of lung cancer. I was interning at a public health hospital in
Boston. Evidently, people dying behind bars looked bad for prison statistics,
so terminally ill prisoners were shipped to my hospital for their final days,
even if there was little we could do for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>It was summer, and the prisoners’ ward had no
air-conditioning, at least for the inmates. We doctors could retreat to the
chilled confines of the nursing station, but the inmates, handcuffed to their
beds, just lay prostrate in the heat on that top floor of the tall, brick
building. When they were shuffled down the hall in front of us, ankles chained
together, they left a trail of sweat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The night the man died, I was on one of my
thirty-six-hour shifts. We worked 117-hour workweeks back then. It’s amazing we
didn’t kill more people ourselves. Overnight, there were only two of us—myself
and a moonlighting doctor who preferred to sleep for his $1,000 paycheck. So
most of the time I was on my own to cover the hundreds of patients there, some
of the sickest of the sick. It was on one of those nights that, staggering
through a sleep-deprived haze, I got the call.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Up until then, all the deaths I had seen were
those in which the patient was either dead on arrival or had died during
cardiac “codes,” when we try desperately, and nearly always unsuccessfully, to
resuscitate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>This man was different.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>He was wide-eyed, gasping for air, his cuffed
hands clawing at the bed. The cancer was filling up his lungs with fluid. He
was being drowned by lung cancer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>While he thrashed desperately, pleading, my
mind was in medical mode, all protocols and procedures, but nothing much could
be done. The man needed morphine, but that was held on the other side of the
ward, and I’d never get to it in time, let alone back to him. I was not popular
on the prison floor. I had once reported a guard for beating a sick inmate and
was rewarded with death threats. There was no way they’d let me through the
gates fast enough. I begged the nurse to try to get some, but she didn’t make
it back in time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The man’s coughing turned to gurgling.
“Everything’s going to be okay,” I said. Immediately, I thought, What a stupid
thing to say to someone choking to death. Just another lie in probably a long
line of condescension from other authority figures throughout his life.
Helpless, I turned from doctor back to human being. I took his hand in my own,
which he then gripped with all his might, tugging me toward his tear-streaked,
panic-stricken face. “I’m here,” I said. “I’m right here.” Our gaze remained
locked as he suffocated right in front of me. It felt like watching someone
being tortured to death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Take a deep breath. Now imagine what it would
feel like not to be able to breathe. We all need to take care of our lungs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>America’s number-two killer, lung disease,
claims the lives of about 300,000 people each year. And like our number-one
domestic killer, heart disease, it’s largely preventable. Lung disease can come
in many forms, but the three types that kill the most people are lung cancer,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Lung cancer is our number-one cancer killer.
Most of the 160,000 lung cancer deaths every year are the direct result of
smoking. However, a healthy diet may help mitigate the DNA-damaging effects of
tobacco smoke, as well as perhaps help prevent lung cancer from spreading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>COPD kills approximately 140,000 people
annually, from either damage to the walls of tiny air sacs in the lungs
(emphysema) or from inflamed and thickened airways plugged with thick mucus
(chronic bronchitis). Although there is no cure for the permanent lung scarring
that COPD causes, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may help slow the
progression of the disease and improve lung function for its thirteen million
sufferers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Finally, asthma, which claims 3,000 lives each
year, is one of the most common chronic diseases among children, yet it may be
largely preventable with a healthier diet. Research suggests a few extra daily servings
of fruits and vegetables can reduce both the number of cases of asthma during
childhood and the number of asthma attacks among people with the disease.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>LUNG CANCER</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Lung cancer is diagnosed about 220,000 times
each year in the United States and causes more deaths annually than the next
three cancers combined—those of the colon, breast, and pancreas.<a
href="../../../AppData/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0044.html#chapter2-1">1</a>
At any given moment, nearly 400,000 Americans are living under lung cancer’s
dark shadow.<a
href="../../../AppData/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0044.html#chapter2-2">2</a>
Unlike with heart disease, which has yet to be fully acknowledged as the direct
result of an artery-clogging diet, there is widespread recognition that tobacco
is by far the most common cause of lung cancer. According to the American Lung
Association, smoking tobacco contributes to up to 90 percent of all lung cancer
deaths. Men who smoke are twenty-three times more likely and women thirteen
times more likely to develop lung cancer than nonsmokers. And smokers aren’t
just harming themselves; thousands of deaths each year have been attributed to
secondhand smoke. Nonsmokers have a 20–30 percent higher risk of developing
lung cancer if they’re regularly exposed to cigarette smoke.<a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Those warning labels on cigarette packs are
everywhere now, but for a long time, the link between smoking and lung cancer
was suppressed by powerful interest groups—much as the relationship between
certain foods and other leading killers is suppressed today. For example, in
the 1980s, Philip Morris, the nation’s leading cigarette manufacturer, launched
the notorious Whitecoat Project. The corporation hired doctors to publish
ghostwritten studies purporting to negate links between secondhand smoke and
lung disease. These papers cherry-picked various scientific reports to conceal
and distort the damning evidence of the dangers of secondhand smoke. This
whitewashing, coupled with the tobacco industry’s clever marketing campaigns,
including cartoonlike ads, helped hook generations of Americans onto their
products.<a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>If, despite all the evidence and warnings,
you’re currently a smoker, the most important step you can take is to stop.
Now. Please. The benefits of quitting are immediate. According to the American
Cancer Society, just twenty minutes after quitting, your heart rate and blood
pressure drop. Within a few weeks, your blood circulation and lung function
improve. Within a few months, the sweeper cells that help clean the lungs,
remove mucus, and reduce the risk of infection start to regrow. And within a
year of quitting, your smoking-related risk of coronary heart disease becomes
half that of current smokers.<a

As we saw in chapter 1, the human body possesses a miraculous ability to heal
itself as long as we don’t keep reinjuring it. Simple dietary changes may help
to roll back the damage wrought by the carcinogens in tobacco smoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>First, it’s important to understand the toxic
effects of cigarettes on the lungs. Tobacco smoke contains chemicals that
weaken the body’s immune system, making it more susceptible to disease and
handicapping its ability to destroy cancer cells. At the same time, tobacco smoke
can damage cell DNA, increasing the chance for cancer cells to form and
flourish in the first place.<a
