              Exchange Reactions</b><br>
              <br>
              Ion exchange is a reversible chemical reaction wherein an ion (an 
              atom or molecule that has lost or gained an electron and thus acquired 
              an electrical charge) from solution is exchanged for a similarly 
              charged ion attached to an immobile solid particle. These solid 
              ion exchange particles are either naturally occurring inorganic 
              zeolites or synthetically produced organic resins. The synthetic 
              organic resins are the predominant type used today because their 
              characteristics can be tailored to specific applications.<br>
              <br>
              An organic ion exchange resin is composed of high-molecular-weight 
              polyelectrolytes that can exchange their mobile ions for ions of 
              similar charge from the surrounding medium. Each resin has a distinct 
              number of mobile ion sites that set the maximum quantity of exchanges 
              per unit of resin.<br>
              <br>
              Most plating process water is used to cleanse the surface of the 
              parts after each process bath. To maintain quality standards, the 
              level of dissolved solids in the rinse water must be regulated. 
              Fresh water added to the rinse tank accomplishes this purpose, and 
              the overflow water is treated to remove pollutants and then discharged. 
              As the metal salts, acids, and bases used in metal finishing are 
              primarily inorganic compounds, they are ionized in water and could 
              be removed by contact with ion exchange resins. In a water deionization 
              process, the resins exchange hydrogen ions (H+) for the positively 
              charged ions (such as nickel. copper, and sodium). and hydroxyl 
              ions (OH-) for negatively charged sulfates, chromates. and chlorides. 
              Because the quantity of H+ and OH ions is balanced, the result of 
              the ion exchange treatment is relatively pure, neutral water.<br>
              <img src="A-DEC9a.jpg" alt="Ion Exchange system for water recycling" width="263" height="386" align="right"><br>
              Ion exchange reactions are stoichiometric and reversible, and in 
              that way they are similar to other solution phase reactions. For 
              example:<br>
              <br>
              NiSO4 +Ca(OH)2 = Ni(OH)2 + CaSO4<br>
              <br>
              In this reaction, the nickel ions of the nickel sulfate (NiSO4) 
              are exchanged for the calcium ions of the calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2 
              molecule. Similarly, a resin with hydrogen ions available for exchange 
              will exchange those ions for nickel ions from solution. The reaction 
              can be written as follows:<br>
              <br>
              2(R-SO3H)+ NiSO4 = (R-SO3)2Ni+ H2SO4 (2)<br>
              <br>
              R indicates the organic portion of the resin and SO3 is the immobile 
              portion of the ion active group. Two resin sites are needed for 
              nickel ions with a plus 2 valence (Ni+2). Trivalent ferric ions 
              would require three resin sites.<br>
              <br>
              As shown, the ion exchange reaction is reversible. The degree the 
              reaction proceeds to the right will depend on the resins preference. 
              or selectivity, for nickel ions compared with its preference for 
              hydrogen ions. The selectivity of a resin for a given ion is measured 
              by the selectivity coefficient. K. which in its simplest form for 
              the reaction<br>
              <br>
              R-A++B+=R--B++A+ (3)<br>
              <br>
              is expressed as: K = (concentration of B+ in resin/concentration 
              of A+ in resin) X (concentration of A+ in solution/concentration 
              of B+ in solution).<br>
              <br>
              The selectivity coefficient expresses the relative distribution 
              of the ions when a resin in the A+ form is placed in a solution 
              containing B+ ions. Table 1 gives the selectivity's of strong acid 
              and strong base ion exchange resins for various ionic compounds. 
              It should be pointed out that the selectivity coefficient is not 
              constant but varies with changes in solution conditions. It does 
              provide a means of determining what to expect when various ions 
              are involved. As indicated in Table 1, strong acid resins have a 
              preference for nickel over hydrogen. Despite this preference, the 
              resin can be converted back to the hydrogen form by contact with 
              a concentrated solution of sulfuric acid (H2SO4):<br>
              <br>
              (R--SO4)2Ni + H2SO4 -&gt; 2(R-SO3H) + NiSO4<br>
              <br>
              This step is known as regeneration. In general terms, the higher 
              the preference a resin exhibits for a particular ion, the greater 
              the exchange efficiency in terms of resin capacity for removal of 
              that ion from solution. Greater preference for a particular ion, 
              however, will result in increased consumption of chemicals for regeneration.<br>
              <br>
              Resins currently available exhibit a range of selectivity's and 
              thus have broad application. As an example. for a strong acid resin. 
              the relative preference for divalent calcium ions (Ca+2) over divalent 
              copper ions (Cu+2) is approximately 1.5 to 1. For a heavy-metal-selective 
              resin. the preference is reversed and favors copper by a ratio of 
              2.300 to 1.</font></tt></p>

              <br>
              Ion exchange resins are classified as cation exchangers, which have 
              positively charged mobile ions available for exchange, and anion 
              exchangers, whose exchangeable ions are negatively charged. Both 
              anion and cation resins are produced from the same basic organic 
              polymers. They differ in the ionizable group attached to the hydrocarbon 
              network. It is this functional group that determines the chemical 
              behavior of the resin. Resins can be broadly classified as strong 
              or weak acid cation exchangers or strong or weak base anion exchangers.<br>
              <img src="chin1b.jpg" alt="Metal Recover Ion Exchange (Copper)" width="367" height="291" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10"><br>
              <i>Strong Acid Cation Resins</i>. Strong acid resins are so named 
              because their chemical behavior is similar to that of a strong acid. 
              The resins are highly ionized in both the acid (R-SO3H) and salt 
              (R-SO3Na) form. They can convert a metal salt to the corresponding 
              acid by the reaction:<br>
              <br>
              2(R-SO3H)+ NiCl2 --&gt; (R-SO4),Ni+ 2HCI (5)<br>
              <br>
              The hydrogen and sodium forms of strong acid resins are highly dissociated 
              and the exchangeable Na+ and H+ are readily available for exchange 
              over the entire pH range. Consequently, the exchange capacity of 
              strong acid resins is independent of solution pH. These resins would 
              be used in the hydrogen form for complete deionization; they are 
              used in the sodium form for water softening (calcium and magnesium 
              removal). After exhaustion, the resin is converted back to the hydrogen 
              form (regenerated) by contact with a strong acid solution, or the 
              resin can be convened to the sodium form with a sodium chloride 
              solution. For Equation 5. hydrochloric acid (HCl) regeneration would 
              result in a concentrated nickel chloride (NiCl,) solution.<br>
              <br>
              <i>Weak Acid Cation Basins</i>. In a weak acid resin. the ionizable 
              group is a carboxylic acid (COOH) as opposed to the sulfonic acid 
              group (SO3H) used in strong acid resins. These resins behave similarly 
              to weak organic acids that are weakly dissociated.<br>
              <br>
              Weak acid resins exhibit a much higher affinity for hydrogen ions 
              than do strong acid resins. This characteristic allows for regeneration 
              to the hydrogen form with significantly less acid than is required 
              for strong acid resins. Almost complete regeneration can be accomplished 
              with stoichiometric amounts of acid. The degree of dissociation 
              of a weak acid resin is strongly influenced by the solution pH. 
              Consequently, resin capacity depends in part on solution pH. Figure 
              1 shows that a typical weak acid resin has limited capacity below 
              a pH of 6.0. making it unsuitable for deionizing acidic metal finishing 
              wastewater.<br>
              <br>
              <i>Strong Base Anion Resins</i>. Like strong acid resins. strong 
              base resins are highly ionized and can be used over the entire pH 
              range. These resins are used in the hydroxide (OH) form for water 
              deionization. They will react with anions in solution and can convert 
              an acid solution to pure water:<br>
              <br>
              R--NH3OH+ HCl -&gt; R-NH3Cl + HOH (6)<br>
              <br>
              Regeneration with concentrated sodium hydroxide (NaOH) converts 
              the exhausted resin to the hydroxide form.<br>
              <br>
              <i>Weak Base Anion Resins.</i> Weak base resins are like weak acid 
              resins. in that the degree of ionization is strongly influenced 
              by pH. Consequently, weak base resins exhibit minimum exchange capacity 
              above a pH of 7.0 (Figure 1). These resins merely sorb strong acids: 
              they cannot split salts.<br>
              </font></tt></p>

              Figure 1.<br>

              as a Function of solution pH </font></tt></p>
            <p align="left"><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              <br>
              In an ion exchange wastewater deionization unit. the wastewater 
              would pass first through a bed of strong acid resin. Replacement 
              of the metal cations (Ni+2. Cu+2) With hydrogen ions would lower 
              the solution pH. The anions (SO4-2. Cl-) can then be removed with 
              a weak base resin because the entering wastewater will normally 
              be acidic and weak base resins sorb acids. Weak base resins are 
              preferred over strong base resins because they require less regenerant 
              chemical. A reaction between the resin in the free base form and 
              HCl would proceed as follows:</font></tt></p>
            <p align="center"><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              <br>
              R-NH2 + HCl -&gt; R-NH3Cl (7)</font></tt></p>
            <p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              <br>
              The weak base resin does not have a hydroxide ion form as does the 
              strong base resin. Consequently. regeneration needs only to neutralize 
              the absorbed acid: it need not provide hydroxide ions. Less expensive 
              weakly basic reagents such as ammonia (NH3) or sodium carbonate 
              can be employed.<br>
              <br>
              Heavy-Metal-Selective Chelating Resins. Chelating resins behave 
              similarly to weak acid cation resins but exhibit a high degree of 
              selectivity for heavy metal cations. Chelating resins are analogous 
              to chelating compounds found in metal finishing wastewater; that 
              is, they tend to form stable complexes with the heavy metals. In 
              fact. the functional group used in these resins is an EDTAa compound. 
              The resin structure in the sodium form is expressed as R-EDTA-Na. 
              <br>
              <img src="Lllabs-A.jpg" alt="Ion Exchange for Chrome in Groundwater" width="392" height="331" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10"> 
              <br>
              The high degree of selectivity for heavy metals permits separation 
              of these ionic compounds from solutions containing high background 
              levels of calcium, magnesium, and sodium ions. A chelating resin 
              exhibits greater selectivity for heavy metals in its sodium form 
              than in its hydrogen form. Regeneration properties are similar to 
              those of a weak acid resin; the chelating resin can be converted 
              to the hydrogen form with slightly greater than stoichiometric doses 
              of acid because of the fortunate tendency of the heavy metal complex 
              to become less stable under low pH conditions. Potential applications 
              of the chelating resin include polishing to lower the heavy metal 
              concentration in the effluent from a hydroxide treatment process 
              or directly removing toxic heavy metal cations from wastewaters 
              containing a high concentration of nontoxic, multivalent cations.<br>
              <br>
              Table 2 shows the preference of a commercially available chelating 
              resin for heavy metal cations over calcium ions. (The chelating 
              resins exhibit a similar magnitude of selectivity for heavy metals 
              over sodium or magnesium ions.) The selectivity coefficient defines 
              the relative preference the resin exhibits for different ions. The 
              preference for copper (shown in Table 2) is 2300 times that for 
              calcium. Therefore, when a solution is treated that contains equal 
              molar concentrations of copper and calcium ions, at equilibrium. 
              the molar concentration of copper ions on the resin will be 2300 
              times the concentration of calcium ions. Or, when solution is treated 
              that contains a calcium ion molarconcentration 2300 times that of 
              the copper ion concentration, at equilibrium. the resin would hold 
              an equal concentration of copper and calcium.<br>

              <b>Batch and Column Exchange Systems</b><br>
              <br>
              Ion exchange processing can be accomplished by either a batch method 
              or a column method. In the first method, the resin and solution 
              are mixed in a batch tank, the exchange is allowed to come to equilibrium, 
              then the resin is separated from solution. The degree to which the 
              exchange takes place is limited by the preference the resin exhibits 
              for the ion in solution. Consequently, the use of the resins exchange 
              capacity will be limited unless the selectivity for the ion in solution 
              is far greater than for the exchangeable ion attached to the resin. 
              Because batch regeneration of the resin is chemically inefficient, 
              batch processing by ion exchange has limited potential for application.<br>
              <br>
              Passing a solution through a column containing a bed of exchange 
              resin is analogous to treating the solution in an infinite series 
              of batch tanks. Consider a series of tanks each containing 1 equivalent 
              (eq) of resin in the X ion form (see Figure 2). A volume of solution 
              containing 1 eq of Y ions is charged into the first tank. Assuming 
              the resin to have an equal preference for ions X and Y. when equilibrium 
              is reached the solution phase will contain 0.5 eq of X and Y. Similarly. 
              the resin phase will contain 0.5 eq of X and Y. This separation 
              is the equivalent of that achieved in a batch process.<br>
              <img src="Pdrm0389A.jpg" alt="Small Ion Exchange System" width="305" height="391" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10"><br>
              If the solution were removed from Tank 1 and added to Tank 2, which 
              also contained 1 eq of resin in the X ion form, the solution and 
              resin phase would both contain 0.25 eq of Y ion and 0.75 eq of X 
              ion. Repeating the procedure in a third and fourth tank would reduce 
              the solution content of Y ions to 0.125 and 0.0625 eq. respectively. 
              Despite an unfavorable resin preference. using a sufficient number 
              of stages could reduce the concentration of Y ions in solution to 
              any level desired.<br>
              <br>
              This analysis simplifies the column technique, but it does provide 
              insights into the process dynamics. Separations are possible despite 
              poor selectivity for the ion being removed.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Ion Exchange Process Equipment and Operation</b><br>
              <br>
              Most industrial applications of ion exchange use fixed-bed column 
              systems, the basic component of which is the resin column (Figure 
              3). The column design must:<br>

            </ul>
            <p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              Regeneration Procedure. After the feed solution is processed to 
              the extent that the resin becomes exhausted and cannot accomplish 
              any further ion exchange, the resin must be regenerated. In normal 
              column operation, for a cation system being converted first to the 
              hydrogen then to the sodium form, regeneration employs the following 
              basic steps:<br>
              <br>
              1. The column is backwashed to remove suspended solids collected 
              by the bed during the service cycle and to eliminate channels that 
              may have formed during this cycle. The back- wash flow fluidizes 
              the bed. releases trapped particles. and reorients the resin particles 
              according to size.</font></tt></p>

            <p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              During backwash the larger, denser panicles will accumulate at the 
              base and the particle size will decrease moving up the column. This 
              distribution yields a good hydraulic flow pattern and resistance 
              to fouling by suspended solids. <br>
              <br>
              2. The resin bed is brought in con- tact with the regenerant solution. 
              In the case of the cation resin. acid elutes the collected ions 
              and converts the bed to the hydrogen form. A slow water rinse then 
              removes any residual acid. <br>
              <br>
              3. The bed is brought in contact with a sodium hydroxide solution 
              to convert the resin to the sodium form. Again, a slow water rinse 
              is used to remove residual caustic. The slow rinse pushes the last 
              of the regenerant through the column. <br>
              <br>
              4. The resin bed is subjected to a fast rinse that removes the last 
              traces of the regenerant solution and ensures good flow characteristics. 
              <br>
              <br>
              5. The column is returned to service. </font></tt></p>

              <br>
              For resins that experience significant swelling or shrinkage during 
              regeneration, a second backwash should be performed after regeneration 
              to eliminate channeling or resin compression. Regeneration of a 
              fixed-bed column usually requires between 1 and 2 h. Frequency depends 
              on the volume of resin in the exchange columns and the quantity 
              of heavy metals and other ionized compounds in the wastewater.<br>
              <br>
              Resin capacity is usually expressed in terms of equivalents per 
              liter (eq/L) of resin. An equivalent is the molecular weight in 
              grams of the compound divided by its electrical charge. or valence. 
              For example. a resin with an exchange capacity of 1 eq/L could remove 
              37.5 g of divalent zinc (Zn+2, molecular weight of 65) from solution. 
              Much of the experience with ion exchange has been in the field of 
              water softening: therefore, capacities will frequently be expressed 
              in terms of kilograins of calcium carbonate per cubic foot of resin. 
              This unit can be converted to equivalents per liter by multiplying 
              by 0.0458. Typical capacities for commercially available cation 
              and anion resins are shown in Figure 4. The capacities are strongly 
              influenced by the quantity of acid or base used to regenerate the 
              resin. Weak acid and weak base systems are more efficiently regenerated; 
              their capacity increases almost linearly with regenerant dose.<br>
              <br>
              Cocurrent and Countercurrent Regeneration. Columns are designed 
              to use either cocurrent or countercurrent regeneration. In cocurrent 
              units, both feed and regenerant solutions make contact with the 
              resin in a downflow mode. These units are the less expensive of 
              the two in terms of initial equipment cost. On the other hand, cocurrent 
              flow uses regenerant chemicals less efficiently than countercurrent 
              flow: it has higher leakage concentrations (the concentration of 
              the feed solution ion being removed in the column effluent), and 
              cannot achieve as high a product concentration in the regenerant.<br>
              <br>
              Efficient use of regenerant chemicals is primarily a concern with 
              strong acid or strong base resins. The weakly ionized resins require 
              only slightly greater than stoichiometric chemical doses for complete 
              regeneration regardless of whether cocurrent or countercurrent flow 
              is used.</font></tt></p>

              <i>Regenerant Reuse</i>. With strong acid or strong base resin systems. 
              improved chemical efficiency can be achieved by reusing a part of 
              the spent regenerants. In strongly ionized resin systems, the degreeof 
              column regeneration is the major factor in determining the chemical 
              efficiency of the regeneration process. (See Figure 5.) To realize 
              42 percent of the resin's theoretical exchange capacity requires 
              1.4 times the stoichiometric amount of reagent [2 lb HCl/ft3 (32 
              g HCI/L)]. To increase the exchange capacity available to 60 percent 
              of theoretical increases consumption to 2.45 times the stoichiometric 
              dose [5 Ib HCl/ft3 (80 g HCI/L)].<br>
              <br>
              The need for acid doses considerably higher than stoichiometric 
              means that there is a significant concentration of acid in the spent 
              regenerant. Further. as the acid dose is increased incrementally, 
              the concentration of acid in the spent regenerant increases. By 
              discarding only the first part of the spent regenerant and saving 
              and reusing the rest. <br>
              greater exchange capacity can be realized with equal levels of regenerant 
              consumption. For example, if a regenerant dose of 5 Ib HCl/ft3 (80 
              g HCI/L) were used in the resin system in Figure 5, the first 50 
              percent of spent regenerant would contain only 29 percent of the 
              original acid concentration. The rest of the acid regenerant would 
              contain 78 percent of the original acid concentration. If this second 
              part of the regenerant is reused in the next regeneration cycle 
              before the resin bed makes contact with 5 Ib/ft3 (80 g/L) of fresh 
              HCI, the exchange capacity would increase to 67 percent of theoretical 
              capacity. The available capacity would then increase from 60 to 
              67 percent at equal chemical doses. Figure 5 shows the improved 
              reagent utilization achieved by this manner of reuse over a range 
              of regenerant doses.</font></tt></p>

              Regenerant reuse has disadvantages in that it is higher in initial 
              cost for chemical storage and feed systems and regeneration procedure 
              is more complicated. Still. where the chemical savings have provided 
              justification, systems have been designed to reuse parts of the 
              spent regenerant as many as five times before discarding them.<br>
