<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>My mom’s father died of a stroke, and her
mother died of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>As a kid, I loved going to see my grandma in
Long Island. We lived out west, so I got to fly on a plane—sometimes all by
myself! She was the perfect—and perfectly doting—grandmother. She’d want to
take me to toy stores, but, geeky me, I just wanted to go to the library. When
we’d get back to the house, my arms filled with borrowed books, she’d let me
sit way back on her big couch—shoes off, of course—and read and draw pictures.
Then she’d bring me blueberry muffins she made with a big mechanical mixer that
took up half the kitchen counter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Later in life, my grandma started to lose her
mind. By then, I was in medical school, but my newfound knowledge was useless.
She had turned. My previously sweet and stately grandmother? Now she threw
things at people. She cursed. Her caretaker showed me the teeth marks on her
arm where my once kind, loving grandma had bitten her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>That’s the horror of brain disease. Unlike a
problem with your foot or your back or even another vital organ, brain disease
can attack your self.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The two most serious brain diseases are stroke,
which kills nearly 130,000 Americans each year,<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-1"><span
style='color:blue'>1</span></a> and Alzheimer’s disease, which kills nearly
85,000.<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-2"><span
style='color:blue'>2</span></a> Most strokes can be thought of as “brain
attacks”—like heart attacks, but the rupturing plaques in your arteries cut off
blood flow to parts of the brain rather than to parts of the heart. Alzheimer’s
is more like a mind attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most physically
and emotionally burdensome diseases, for both sufferers and caregivers. Unlike
stroke, which can kill instantly and without any warning, Alzheimer’s involves
a slower, more subtle decline over months or years. Instead of
cholesterol-filled plaques in your arteries, plaques made of a substance called
amyloid develop in the brain tissue itself, associated with the loss of memory
and, eventually, loss of life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>While the pathology of stroke and Alzheimer’s
are different, one key factor unites them: Mounting evidence suggests that a
healthy diet may help prevent them both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>STROKE</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In about 90 percent of strokes,<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-3"><span
style='color:blue'>3</span></a> blood flow to part of the brain gets cut off,
depriving it of oxygen and killing off the part fed by the clogged artery.
That’s called an ischemic stroke (from the Latin ischaemia, meaning “stopping
blood”). A small minority of strokes are hemorrhagic strokes, which are caused
by bleeding into the brain when a blood vessel bursts. The damage wrought by a
stroke depends on which area of the brain was deprived of oxygen (or where
bleeding occurred) and for how long the deprivation lasted. People who
experience a brief stroke might only need to contend with arm or leg weakness,
while those who suffer a major stroke can develop paralysis, lose the ability
to speak, or, as is too often the case, die.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Sometimes the blood clot lasts only a
moment—not long enough to notice but still long enough to kill off a tiny
portion of your brain. These so-called silent strokes can multiply and slowly
reduce cognitive function until full-blown dementia develops.<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-4"><span
style='color:blue'>4</span></a> The goal is to reduce the risk of both the
massive strokes that can kill you instantly and the ministrokes that kill you
over the course of years. Just as with heart disease, a healthy diet can reduce
stroke risk by reducing cholesterol and blood pressure while improving blood
flow and antioxidant capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Fiber! Fiber! Fiber!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In addition to its well-known effects on bowel
health, high fiber intake appears to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-5"><span

href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-10"><span
style='color:blue'>10</span></a> A number of studies now show that high fiber
intake may also help ward off stroke.<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-11"><span
style='color:blue'>11</span></a> Unfortunately, less than 3 percent of
Americans meet the minimum daily recommendation for fiber.<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-12"><span
style='color:blue'>12</span></a> This means about 97 percent of Americans eat
fiber-deficient diets. Fiber is naturally concentrated in only one place: whole
plant foods. Processed foods have less, and animal-derived foods have no fiber
at all. Animals have bones to hold them up; plants have fiber.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>It apparently doesn’t take much fiber to cut
stroke risk. Increasing fiber intake by just seven grams a day may be
associated with a 7 percent risk reduction.<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-13"><span
style='color:blue'>13</span></a> Different strokes for different folks—depending,
evidently, on how much fiber they ate. An additional seven grams of fiber is
easy to add to your diet; it’s the equivalent of a bowl of oatmeal with berries
or a serving of baked beans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>How does fiber protect the brain? We’re not
exactly sure. We do know that fiber helps control your cholesterol<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-14"><span
style='color:blue'>14</span></a> and blood sugar levels,<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-15"><span
style='color:blue'>15</span></a> which can help reduce the amount of
artery-clogging plaque in your brain’s blood vessels. High-fiber diets may also
lower blood pressure,<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-16"><span
style='color:blue'>16</span></a> which reduces the risk of brain bleeds. But
scientists don’t have to know the exact mechanism before you act on this
knowledge. As the biblical passage goes: “A man scatters seed on the
ground&nbsp;… the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.” Had the
farmer from scripture postponed his sowing until he understood the biology of
seed germination, he wouldn’t have lasted very long. So why not go ahead and
reap the benefits of eating fiber by eating more unprocessed plant foods?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>It’s never too early to start eating healthier.
Though stroke is considered an older person’s disease—only about 2 percent of
stroke deaths occur before the age of forty-five<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-17"><span
style='color:blue'>17</span></a>—the risk factors may begin accumulating in
childhood. In a remarkable study published recently, hundreds of children were
followed for a period of twenty-four years, from junior high school to
adulthood. Researchers found that low fiber intake early on was associated with
stiffening of the arteries leading up to the brain—a key risk factor for
stroke. By the time these adolescents were only fourteen, clear differences in
arterial health were found for those consuming different amounts of fiber in
their daily diets.<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-18"><span
style='color:blue'>18</span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Again, it did not appear to take much. One more
apple, an extra quarter cup of broccoli, or just two tablespoons of beans a day
during childhood could translate into a meaningful effect on artery health
later in life.<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-19"><span
style='color:blue'>19</span></a> If you really want to be proactive, the best
available science<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-20"><span
style='color:blue'>20</span></a> suggests you can minimize stroke risk by
eating a minimum of 25 grams a day of soluble fiber (fiber that dissolves in
water, typically found in beans, oats, nuts, and berries) and 47 daily grams of
insoluble fiber (fiber that does not dissolve in water, found primarily in
whole grains, such as brown rice and whole wheat). Granted, you’d have to eat
an extraordinarily healthy diet to attain this level of fiber intake, far
beyond what is arbitrarily determined as adequate by most health authorities.<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-21"><span
style='color:blue'>21</span></a> Rather than patronizing you with what they
think is “achievable”<a
href="../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/part0045.html#chapter3-22"><span
style='color:blue'>22</span></a> by the masses, though, I wish these
authorities would just tell you what the science says and let you make up your
own mind.</span></p>
