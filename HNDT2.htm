<font color="#003d73"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">How Not to Die from Lung Diseases</font></font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The worst death I ever witnessed was that of a man dying of lung cancer. I was interning at a public health hospital in Boston. Evidently, people dying behind bars looked bad for prison statistics, so terminally ill prisoners were shipped to my hospital for their final days, even if there was little we could do for them.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It was summer, and the prisoners&rsquo; ward had no air-conditioning, at least for the inmates. We doctors could retreat to the chilled confines of the nursing station, but the inmates, handcuffed to their beds, just lay prostrate in the heat on that top floor of the tall, brick building. When they were shuffled down the hall in front of us, ankles chained together, they left a trail of sweat.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The night the man died, I was on one of my thirty-six-hour shifts. We worked 117-hour workweeks back then. It&rsquo;s amazing we didn&rsquo;t kill more people ourselves. Overnight, there were only two of us&mdash;myself and a moonlighting doctor who preferred to sleep for his $1,000 paycheck. So most of the time I was on my own to cover the hundreds of patients there, some of the sickest of the sick. It was on one of those nights that, staggering through a sleep-deprived haze, I got the call.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Up until then, all the deaths I had seen were those in which the patient was either dead on arrival or had died during cardiac &ldquo;codes,&rdquo; when we try desperately, and nearly always unsuccessfully, to resuscitate.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This man was different.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He was wide-eyed, gasping for air, his cuffed hands clawing at the bed. The cancer was filling up his lungs with fluid. He was being drowned by lung cancer.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">While he thrashed desperately, pleading, my mind was in medical mode, all protocols and procedures, but nothing much could be done. The man needed morphine, but that was held on the other side of the ward, and I&rsquo;d never get to it in time, let alone back to him. I was not popular on the prison floor. I had once reported a guard for beating a sick inmate and was rewarded with death threats. There was no way they&rsquo;d let me through the gates fast enough. I begged the nurse to try to get some, but she didn&rsquo;t make it back in time.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The man&rsquo;s coughing turned to gurgling. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s going to be okay,&rdquo; I said. Immediately, I thought, What a stupid thing to say to someone choking to death. Just another lie in probably a long line of condescension from other authority figures throughout his life. Helpless, I turned from doctor back to human being. I took his hand in my own, which he then gripped with all his might, tugging me toward his tear-streaked, panic-stricken face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo; Our gaze remained locked as he suffocated right in front of me. It felt like watching someone being tortured to death.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Take a deep breath. Now imagine what it would feel like not to be able to breathe. We all need to take care of our lungs.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">*   *   *</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">America&rsquo;s number-two killer, lung disease, claims the lives of about 300,000 people each year. And like our number-one domestic killer, heart disease, it&rsquo;s largely preventable. Lung disease can come in many forms, but the three types that kill the most people are lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Lung cancer is our number-one cancer killer. Most of the 160,000 lung cancer deaths every year are the direct result of smoking. However, a healthy diet may help mitigate the DNA-damaging effects of tobacco smoke, as well as perhaps help prevent lung cancer from spreading.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">COPD kills approximately 140,000 people annually, from either damage to the walls of tiny air sacs in the lungs (emphysema) or from inflamed and thickened airways plugged with thick mucus (chronic bronchitis). Although there is no cure for the permanent lung scarring that COPD causes, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may help slow the progression of the disease and improve lung function for its thirteen million sufferers.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Finally, asthma, which claims 3,000 lives each year, is one of the most common chronic diseases among children, yet it may be largely preventable with a healthier diet. Research suggests a few extra daily servings of fruits and vegetables can reduce both the number of cases of asthma during childhood and the number of asthma attacks among people with the disease.</font></font>

<font color="#003d73"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">LUNG CANCER</font></font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Lung cancer is diagnosed about 220,000 times each year in the United States and causes more deaths annually than the next three cancers combined&mdash;those of the colon, breast, and pancreas.1 At any given moment, nearly 400,000 Americans are living under lung cancer&rsquo;s dark shadow.2 Unlike with heart disease, which has yet to be fully acknowledged as the direct result of an artery-clogging diet, there is widespread recognition that tobacco is by far the most common cause of lung cancer. According to the American Lung Association, smoking tobacco contributes to up to 90 percent of all lung cancer deaths. Men who smoke are twenty-three times more likely and women thirteen times more likely to develop lung cancer than nonsmokers. And smokers aren&rsquo;t just harming themselves; thousands of deaths each year have been attributed to secondhand smoke. Nonsmokers have a 20&ndash;30 percent higher risk of developing lung cancer if they&rsquo;re regularly exposed to cigarette smoke.3</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Those warning labels on cigarette packs are everywhere now, but for a long time, the link between smoking and lung cancer was suppressed by powerful interest groups&mdash;much as the relationship between certain foods and other leading killers is suppressed today. For example, in the 1980s, Philip Morris, the nation&rsquo;s leading cigarette manufacturer, launched the notorious Whitecoat Project. The corporation hired doctors to publish ghostwritten studies purporting to negate links between secondhand smoke and lung disease. These papers cherry-picked various scientific reports to conceal and distort the damning evidence of the dangers of secondhand smoke. This whitewashing, coupled with the tobacco industry&rsquo;s clever marketing campaigns, including cartoonlike ads, helped hook generations of Americans onto their products.4</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If, despite all the evidence and warnings, you&rsquo;re currently a smoker, the most important step you can take is to stop. Now. Please. The benefits of quitting are immediate. According to the American Cancer Society, just twenty minutes after quitting, your heart rate and blood pressure drop. Within a few weeks, your blood circulation and lung function improve. Within a few months, the sweeper cells that help clean the lungs, remove mucus, and reduce the risk of infection start to regrow. And within a year of quitting, your smoking-related risk of coronary heart disease becomes half that of current smokers.5 As we saw in chapter 1, the human body possesses a miraculous ability to heal itself as long as we don&rsquo;t keep reinjuring it. Simple dietary changes may help to roll back the damage wrought by the carcinogens in tobacco smoke.</font></font>

<font color="#003d73"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Load Up on Broccoli</font></font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">First, it&rsquo;s important to understand the toxic effects of cigarettes on the lungs. Tobacco smoke contains chemicals that weaken the body&rsquo;s immune system, making it more susceptible to disease and handicapping its ability to destroy cancer cells. At the same time, tobacco smoke can damage cell DNA, increasing the chance for cancer cells to form and flourish in the first place.6</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">To test the power of dietary interventions to prevent DNA damage, scientists often study chronic smokers. Researchers rounded up a group of longtime smokers and asked them to consume twenty-five times more broccoli than the average American&mdash;in other words, a single stalk a day. Compared to broccoli-avoiding smokers, the broccoli-eating smokers suffered 41 percent fewer DNA mutations in their bloodstream over ten days. Is that just because the broccoli boosted the activity of the detoxifying enzymes in their livers, which helped clear carcinogens before they even made it to the smokers&rsquo; cells? No, even when DNA was extracted from the subjects&rsquo; bodies and exposed to a known DNA-damaging chemical, the genetic material from the broccoli eaters showed significantly less damage, suggesting that eating vegetables like broccoli may make you more resilient at a subcellular level.7</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Now, don&rsquo;t think this means that eating a stalk of broccoli before smoking a pack of Marlboro Reds is going to completely erase the cancer-causing effects of cigarette smoke. It won&rsquo;t. But as you&rsquo;re trying to quit, such vegetables as broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower may help prevent further damage.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The benefits of broccoli-family (cruciferous) vegetables may not stop there. While breast cancer is the most common internal cancer among American women, lung cancer is actually their number-one killer. About 85 percent of women with breast cancer are still alive five years after diagnosis, but the numbers are reversed when it comes to lung cancer: 85 percent of women die within five years of a lung cancer diagnosis. Ninety percent of those deaths are due to metastasis, the spread of the cancer to other parts of the body.8</font></font>

<font face="Arial Unicode MS, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Certain compounds in broccoli may have the potential to suppress this metastatic spread. In a 2010 study, scientists laid down a layer of human lung cancer cells in a petri dish and cleared a swath down the middle. Within twenty-four hours, the cancer cells had crept back together, and within thirty hours, the gap had closed completely. But when the scientists dripped some cruciferous-vegetable compounds onto the cancer cells, the cancer creep was stunted.9 Whether or not eating broccoli will help prolong survival in cancer patients has yet to be tested in clinical trials, but the nice thing about healthy dietary interventions is that since they have no downsides, they can be added to whatever other treatments one chooses.</font></font></pre>
