<p class=tni><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>A few years ago,
Millan, a member of the <a href="http://NutritionFacts.org">NutritionFacts.org</a>
community, was kind enough to share her story with me. When she was thirty
years old, she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Millan had struggled with
obesity all her life and suffered through the highs and lows of years of yo-yo
dieting. She had tried nearly every fad diet she could find but, not
surprisingly, would quickly gain back whatever weight she’d lost. Diabetes
wasn’t a stranger to her. Millan’s parents, brothers, and aunt were all
diabetic, so she figured that her own diagnosis was inevitable. It’s age
related. It’s genetic. There was nothing she could do. Or so she thought.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Millan’s initial
diagnosis was back in 1970, and she lived as a diabetic for two decades. Then,
in the 1990s, she switched to an entirely plant-based diet and completely
turned her life around. Today, her energy levels are better than ever, she
looks and feels younger, and she’s finally been able to maintain a healthy
weight. More than four decades after being diagnosed as a diabetic, Millan, now
in her seventies, is fit as a fiddle. She even teaches high-intensity Zumba
classes! She didn’t find some wonder drug or trademarked diet. She simply
decided to eat healthier food.</span></p>

<p class=tni><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The disease called
diabetes mellitus comes from two words: <span class=epub-i1>diabetes</span>
(Greek for “to pass through or siphon”) and <span class=epub-i1>mellitus</span>
(Latin for “honey sweet”). Diabetes mellitus is characterized by chronically
elevated levels of sugar in your blood. This is because either your pancreas
gland isn’t making enough insulin (the hormone that keeps your blood sugar in
check) or because your body becomes resistant to insulin’s effects. The
insulin-deficiency disease is called type 1 diabetes, and the
insulin-resistance disease is called type 2 diabetes. If too much sugar builds
up in your blood, it can overwhelm the kidneys and spill into your urine.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>How did people test
urine before they had modern laboratory techniques? They tasted it. Diabetic
urine can evidently taste as sweet as honey. Hence the name.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Type 2 diabetes has
been called the “Black Death of the twenty-first century” in terms of its
exponential spread around the world and its devastating health impacts. Instead
of the bubonic plague, though, the pathological agents in obesity and type 2
diabetes are identified as “high-fat and high-calorie diets,” and instead of
fleas and rodents, the causes are “advertisements and inducements to poor
lifestyle.”<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0051.html#chapter6-1"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-1>1</a></span> More than twenty million Americans
are currently diagnosed with diabetes, a tripling of cases since 1990.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0051.html#chapter6-2" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-2>2</a></span> At this rate, the CDC predicts that one in three
Americans will be diabetic by midcentury.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0051.html#chapter6-3" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-3>3</a></span> Currently
in the United States, diabetes causes about 50,000 cases of kidney failure,
75,000 lower extremity amputations, 650,000 cases of vision loss,<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0051.html#chapter6-4" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-4>4</a></span> and about 75,000 deaths every year.<span

id=cha-5>5</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Your digestive system
breaks down the carbohydrates you eat into a simple sugar called glucose, which
is the primary fuel powering all the cells in your body. To get from the
bloodstream into your cells, glucose requires insulin. Think of insulin as the
key that unlocks the doors to your cells to allow glucose to enter. Every time
you eat a meal, insulin is released by your pancreas to help shuttle the
glucose into your cells. Without insulin, your cells can’t accept glucose, and,
as a result, the glucose builds up in your blood. Over time, this extra sugar
can damage the blood vessels throughout the body. That’s why diabetes can lead
to blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, and stroke. High blood sugar can
also damage your nerves, creating a condition known as neuropathy that can
cause numbness, tingling, and pain. Because of the damage to their blood
vessels and nerves, diabetics may also suffer from poor circulation and lack of
feeling in the legs and feet, which can lead to poorly healing injuries that
can, in turn, end as amputations.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Type 1 diabetes,
previously called juvenile-onset diabetes, represents approximately 5 percent
of all diagnosed diabetes cases.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0051.html#chapter6-6" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-6>6</a></span> In
most people with type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly destroys the
insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Without insulin, blood sugar
rises to unsafe levels. Type 1 diabetes is therefore treated with injections of
insulin, a type of hormone-replacement therapy, to make up for the lack of
production. The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, though a genetic
predisposition combined with exposure to such environmental triggers as viral
infection and/or cow’s milk may play a role.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0051.html#chapter6-7" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-7>7</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Type 2 diabetes,
previously known as adult-onset diabetes, accounts for 90–95 percent of
diabetes cases.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0051.html#chapter6-8"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-8>8</a></span> In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas can
make insulin, but it doesn’t work as well. The accumulation of fat inside the
cells of your muscles and liver interferes with the action of insulin.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0051.html#chapter6-9" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-9>9</a></span> If insulin is the key that unlocks the doors to your
cells, saturated fat is what appears to gum up the locks. With glucose denied
entry into your muscles, the primary consumer of such fuel, sugar levels can
rise to damaging levels in your blood. The fat inside these muscle cells can
come from the fat you eat or the fat you wear (i.e., your body fat). The prevention,
treatment, and reversal of type 2 diabetes therefore depends on diet and
lifestyle.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The CDC estimates that
more than twenty-nine million Americans are living with diagnosed or
undiagnosed diabetes—that’s about 9 percent of the U.S. population. Out of one
hundred people you know, chances are six of them already know they are diabetic
and about three have diabetes but haven’t yet been diagnosed. More than one
million new cases of type 2 diabetes are diagnosed each year.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0051.html#chapter6-10" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-10>10</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The good news: Type 2
diabetes is almost always preventable, often treatable, and sometimes even
reversible through diet and lifestyle changes. Like other leading
killers—especially heart disease and high blood pressure—type 2 diabetes is an
unfortunate consequence of your dietary choices. But even if you already have
diabetes and its complications, there is hope. Through lifestyle changes, you
may be able to achieve a complete remission of type 2 diabetes, even if you’ve
been suffering with the disease for decades. In fact, by switching to a healthy
diet, you can start improving your health within a matter of hours.</span></p>

<p class=h align=center style='text-align:center'><span class=epub-b1><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>What Causes Insulin Resistance?</span></span></p>

<p class=tni><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The hallmark of type
2 diabetes is insulin resistance in your muscles. As we’ve learned, insulin
normally enables blood sugar to enter the cells, but when the cells are
resistant and don’t respond to insulin as they should, it can lead to dangerous
levels of sugar remaining in the bloodstream.</span></p>

<p class=tx align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>What causes insulin resistance in the first place?</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Studies dating back
nearly a century note a striking finding. In 1927, researchers divided healthy
young medical students into multiple groups to test out the effects of
different diets. Some were given a fat-rich diet composed of olive oil, butter,
egg yolks, and cream; others were given a carbohydrate-rich diet of sugar,
candy, pastry, white bread, baked potatoes, syrup, bananas, rice, and oatmeal.
Surprisingly, insulin resistance skyrocketed in the fat-rich diet group; within
a matter of days, their blood sugar levels doubled in response to a sugar
challenge, far more than those on the sugar and starch diet.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0051.html#chapter6-11" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-11>11</a></span> It took scientists another seven decades to unravel the
mystery of why this happened, but the answer would provide the key to what
causes type 2 diabetes.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>To understand the role
of diet, we must first understand how the body stores fuel. When athletes talk
about “carb loading” before a competition, they’re referring to the need to
build a fuel supply in their muscles. Carb loading is a more extreme version of
what you do every day: Your digestive system breaks down the starch you eat
into glucose, which enters your circulatory system as blood sugar and is then
stored in your muscles to be used for energy as needed.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Blood sugar, though,
is a little like a vampire: It needs an invitation to come into your cells. And
that invitation is insulin, the key that unlocks the front door of your muscle
cells so glucose can enter. When insulin attaches to insulin receptors on a
cell, it activates a series of enzymes that escort in the glucose. Without
insulin, blood glucose is stuck out in the bloodstream, banging on your cells’
front door, unable to enter. Blood sugar levels then rise, damaging vital
organs in the process. In type 1 diabetes, the body destroys the
insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas, so very little insulin is present
to let blood sugar enter your cells. But with type 2 diabetes, insulin
production isn’t the problem. The key is there, but something has gummed up the
lock. This is called insulin resistance. Your muscle cells become resistant to
the effect of insulin.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>So what’s jamming up
the door locks on your muscle cells, preventing insulin from letting glucose
enter? Fat—more specifically, intramyocellular lipid, the fat inside your
muscle cells.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Fat in your
bloodstream, either from your own fat stores or from your diet, can build up
inside your muscle cells, where it can create toxic breakdown products and free
radicals that block the insulin-signaling process.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0051.html#chapter6-12" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-12>12</a></span> No
matter how much insulin you produce, your fat-compromised muscle cells can’t
effectively use it.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>This mechanism by
which fat interferes with insulin function has been demonstrated by either
infusing fat into people’s bloodstreams and watching insulin resistance shoot up<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0051.html#chapter6-13" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-13>13</a></span> or by removing fat from people’s blood and seeing
insulin resistance drop.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0051.html#chapter6-14" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-14>14</a></span> We
can now even visualize the amount of fat in the muscles using MRI technology.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0051.html#chapter6-15" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-15>15</a></span> Researchers are now able to track the fat going from
the blood into the muscles and watch insulin resistance rise.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0051.html#chapter6-16" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-16>16</a></span> One hit of fat, and within 160 minutes, the absorption
of glucose into your cells becomes compromised.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0051.html#chapter6-17" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-17>17</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Researchers don’t have
to give their study subjects fat through an IV, though. All they have to do is
feed them.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Even among healthy
individuals, a high-fat diet can impair the body’s ability to handle sugar. But
you can lower your insulin resistance by lowering your fat intake. Research has
clearly shown that as the amount of fat in your diet becomes increasingly
lower, insulin works increasingly better.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0051.html#chapter6-18" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-18>18</a></span> Unfortunately,
given the current diets of American children, we’re seeing both obesity and
type 2 diabetes occur earlier and earlier in life.</span></p>

<p class=h align=center style='text-align:center'><span class=epub-b1><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Prediabetes in Children</span></span></p>

<p class=tni><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Prediabetes is
defined by elevated blood sugar levels that are not yet high enough to reach
the official diabetes threshold. Commonly found among those who are overweight
and obese, in the past, prediabetes was regarded as a high-risk state that
presaged diabetes, but it was not thought to be a disease in itself. However,
we now know that prediabetic individuals may already be experiencing organ
damage.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Prediabetics may
already have sugar damage to their kidneys, eyes, blood vessels, and nerves
even before diabetes is diagnosed.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0051.html#chapter6-19" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-19>19</a></span>
Evidence from numerous studies suggests that chronic complications of type 2
diabetes begin occurring during the prediabetic state.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0051.html#chapter6-20" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-20>20</a></span> To
prevent diabetic damage, therefore, we need to prevent prediabetes—and the
earlier, the better.</span></p>
