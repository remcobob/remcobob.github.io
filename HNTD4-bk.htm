among the most commonly diagnosed of all cancers. Thankfully, it is also among
the most treatable if caught early enough. Pancreatic cancer, on the other

its eighteen thousand annual victims.<sup><span style='mso-field-code:" HYPERLINK \0022\0022 "'><u><span

factor for esophageal cancer, or through direct contact with the lining of the
digestive tract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

symptoms. If the cancer is not caught until later stages, treatment is more
difficult and less effective. Starting at age fifty until age seventy-five, you
should either get stool testing every year, stool testing every three years

color:black'>The emergence of colorectal cancer can be broken up into three
stages. The first sign may be what are called aberrant crypt foci, or
abnormal clusters of cells along the lining of the colon. Next come polyps that
grow from that inner surface. The final stage is thought to occur when a benign
polyp transforms into a cancerous one. The cancer can then eat through the wall
of the colon and spread throughout the body. To what degree can curcumin block
each stage of colorectal cancer?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

investigators found that curcumin consumption could reduce the number of those
cancer-associated structures in their rectums up to nearly 40 percent, from
eighteen down to eleven, within just thirty days. The only reported side effect
was a yellow tint to their stools.<sup><span style='mso-field-code:" HYPERLINK \0022\0022 "'><u><span

along with another phytonutrient called quercetin, which is found naturally in
such fruits and vegetables as red onions and grapes, were found to decrease the
number and size of polyps by more than half in patients with a hereditary form
of colorectal cancer. Again, virtually no side effects were reported.<sup><span

last-ditch attempt to save the lives of fifteen patients with advanced
colorectal cancer who didn't respond to any of the standard chemotherapy agents

four months of treatment, it appeared to help stall the disease in one-third of

remarkably safe, even if it just helped one in a hundred, it would be worth
considering. With no serious downsides, a one-in-three potential benefit for
end-stage cancer seems like it would spark further research, right? But who's
going to pay for a study of something that can't be patented?<sup><span

frequent your bowel movements are, the healthier you may be. Based on a study
of twenty-three populations across a dozen countries, the incidence of colon
cancer appears to skyrocket as the average daily stool weight drops below about
a half a pound. Populations dropping quarter pounders appear to have three
times the rate of colon cancer. You can measure the weight of your stools with

“intestinal transit time,” the number of hours it takes for food to travel from
mouth to toilet. The larger the stool, the quicker the transit time, as it’s
easier for your intestines to move things along.<sup><span style='mso-field-code:

color:black'>How long it takes food to get from one end to the other can depend
on gender and dietary habits. Food goes through men eating plant-based diets in
just a day or two, but this transit time takes as long as five or more days
among those eating more conventional diets. Women eating plant-based diets also
average a day or two, but the average intestinal transit time in most women
eating conventional diets may be four days.<sup><span style='mso-field-code:

you can be regular but four days late. You can measure your own oral-anal
transit time by eating some beets and noting when your stools turn pink. If that

healthy half-pound target.<sup><span style='mso-field-code:" HYPERLINK \0022\0022 "'><u><span
