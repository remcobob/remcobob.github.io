              <a name="1"><i>Q. What is the level of compliance I can expect? 
              </i><br>
              <br>
              A. With most divalent ions (Copper, Lead, Nickel, etc) the effluent 
              will usually contain less than 0.5 ppm (usually between .05 and 
              .2 ppm). Trivalent ions such as Chrome and Iron are lower. The key 
              to reducing effluent metal levels is having the correct sizing of 
              the resin bed for the flow rate. We use 1 gallon per minute per 
              cubic foot of resin with a minimum of a 30 inch bed. With two columns 
              in line, the leakage level is very low. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="2"><i>Q. What is the difference between deionization 
              and metal recovery ion exchange. </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Deionization removes all of the ions from the water, leaving 
              only non-ionic materials in solution. Deionizing is best for incoming 
              water of low TDS. In California where TDS is sometimes very high, 
              an RO (reverse osmosis) system is usually used first to reduce the 
              TDS to very low levels followed by the DI system as a polisher. 
              Treating waste water is more complicated and DI systems leave most 
              non-ionic organics in solution. <br>
              <br>
              Metal recovery ion exchange targets only the ions that are required 
              to be removed from the waste stream. The rest, including Sodium, 
              sulfate, chloride, phosphate, etc, are not removed. Unless you wish 
              to recycle water, it doesn't make much sense to remove all of the 
              ions that are not regulated. Chelated resins have a &quot;preference&quot; 
              for heavy metals and pass Calcium and Magnesium (the hardness ions) 
              which a DI type system will take out. The main difference between 
              the two systems is with a DI systems, you regenerate a lot, treat 
              a lot of regenerant with low metal levels, use a lot of chemicals 
              and reuse the water.<br>
              A metal recover IX system has a low regeneration frequency based 
              only on the metal captured, not otherions, creates about 1/3 as 
              much regenerant per cu. ft of resin regenerated and up to 1/10 as 
              much regenerant per pound of metal, but you cannot reuse the water 
              unless you use a following RO (still cheaper than DI overall). <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="3"><i>Q. How does Ion Exchange work? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. The best analogy I have found is comparing the resin bead to 
              a ball of yarn. The fuzz on the yarn strands are the exchange sites. 
              Like the yarn, the resin bead is a long string (molecule) wrapped 
              around itself. The exchange sites are where ions such as H+ or Na+ 
              are exchanged for the heavy metals. The resins prefer the metals 
              over H+ or Sodium and readily take up the metal and release the 
              H+ or Na+. When the resin is freshly regenerated, many surface sites 
              are available and the rate of exchange is high. As the resin sites 
              fill up, the availability of sites decrease and the rate of exchange 
              slows. This is why, at a constant concentration and flow rate, the 
              leakage increases during a run. When the only sites available are 
              deep inside the beads, the rate of exchange is slow and more metal 
              leaks through. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="4"><i>Q. I have a Total Dissolved Solids(TDS) limit, 
              what does ion exchange do to my TDS? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. In theory, chelated resin systems does not change the TDS in 
              the effluent stream. The heavy metal is exchanged for Sodium so 
              the TDS remains constant. Some increase in TDS is apparent due to 
              pH and/or ORP adjustment in the conditioning stage. During regeneration, 
              some excess caustic is added which will increase the total TDS slightly. 
              This is still much less of an increase than is used in a precipitation 
              system. The total TDS increase in a precipitation system can be 
              2 to 3 times the TDS in the actual effluent stream. <br>
              <br>
              In a deionizing system where both cation and anions are removed, 
              the TDS in the effluent stream is lowered during normal operation, 
              but due to the high levels of regenerant required, the total TDS 
              loading is higher than with a Chelate resin system for just metal 
              recovery. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="5"><i>Q. How much floor space does an ion exchange 
              system occupy?</i><br>
              <br>
              A. Integrated chelated resin systems are compact, a 25 gpm system 
              will occupy an area 8' x 12'. Only one storage tank is needed and 
              that is mounted on the skid. DI type systems are more compact but 
              require more overall floor space due to the waste regenerant storage. 
              At least two large tanks are required for dilute acid and dilute 
              caustic storage. In addition, the regenerant plateout cell, if used, 
              will require more space due to the 3x volume of regenerant per pound 
              of metal recovered.<br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="6"><i>Q. How much does it cost to run an ion exchange 
              system? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. The cost to operate is a total of three variables. These are, 
              power, chemistry (regenerant and pH adjust) and labor. <br>
              <br>
              Power Costs- <br>
              <br>
              The power requirement is about 1.5 hp for 15 gpm up to 3 hp for 
              40 gpm. This is constant while the system is running. A 3 hp, 3 
              ph motor costs about 5 cents per hour to operate (or less). Power 
              costs compare favorably with precipitation systems and are much 
              lower than systems using membranes or evaporation.<br>
              <br>
              Chemistry Costs-<br>
              <br>
              Chelated resins for Copper and Nickel recovery. <br>
              <br>
              The chemistry costs for a chelate resin is about 1 gallon of sulfuric 
              per cubic foot of resin and one gallon of 50% caustic per cubic 
              foot of resin per regeneration. Approximately 70% of the sulfuric 
              can be recovered per regeneration. This is a net cost of .3 gallons 
              of sulfuric and 1 gallon of 50 % caustic. This is per 1.9 pounds 
              of Copper recovered. The cost of pH adjusting is low as the systems 
              run at a pH between 3.5 and 4.5. pH is increased as the effluent 
              passes through the column. <br>
              <br>
              DI resin systems. <br>
              <br>
              The chemistry cost of DI type systems is higher as it is difficult 
              to reuse the regenerants due to the huge volume of regenerant used. 
              It takes approximately 3 gallons of sulfuric per 1.9 pounds of Copper 
              recovered plus an equivalent amount of Caustic to regenerate the 
              anion resin. <br>
              <br>
              Labor costs-<br>
              <br>
              Labor costs for the system is usually very low due to the automated 
              nature of the systems. If the proper segregation is used, little 
              or no maintenance is required between regenerations except for chemical 
              maintenance for the pH adjust system. Calibration of pH and ORP 
              probes is a weekly project. Cleaning is a simple backwash procedure 
              taking 5 minutes per column or filter and is usually done once per 
              day. Batch treatment costs may also be lowered because some solutions 
              with low metal levels may be bled directly into the system. Usually 
              2 gallons of sulfuric to regenerate costs less than an hour or two 
              of labor to batch treat. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="7"><i>Q. How much regenerant is used and can I reuse 
              my regenerant? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. For a Copper or Nickel system, about 1 gallon of 93% sulfuric 
              acid is used per cubic foot of resin. This is diluted to a 15% solution 
              so a total of 11 gallons of regenerant is used per cubic foot (15 
              lb acid, 85 lb water). Our unique process also leaches the resin 
              after the regeneration and we us about 2.5 gallons of leach water 
              per cubic foot of resin also. This is added to the regenerant as 
              it is high in acid and metal. We increase the volume of the regenerant 
              by about 20% each cycle so with some acid adjustment, about 75-80% 
              of the regenerant can be reused the next regeneration (if you plate 
              the metal out in between cycles.) <br>
              <br>
              We do not use an eductor to add regenerant to the system, we have 
              a batch tank to hold the correct solution and recirculate it through 
              the system. This method reduces the volume of regenerant generated.<br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="8"><i>Q. How much water is used during a regeneration 
              cycle? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Standard DI systems can use up to 135 gallons per cubic foot 
              of resin during the regeneration cycle. A 40 gpm system regenerates 
              20 cubic feet each cycle. This would generate 2700 gallons of rinse 
              water each cycle. Remco Engineering systems use a much different 
              rinsing scheme. By using a programmable controller for valve control, 
              we can create a much more effective rinsing cycle. We use a fill-leach-fill-leach 
              cycle to reduce water use. The resin beads are small porous spheres 
              which transfer chemicals from the inside to the outside at a slow 
              rate. Running water continuously over the beads doesn't really effect 
              the transfer rate and uses a lot of water. We fill the column to 
              cover the beads, hold till we are close to equilibrium, then blow 
              the water out of the tank. We do this several times until the beads 
              quit leaching chemicals. We generally use about 30-40 gallons per 
              cubic foot of resin or 600-800 gallons for a 20 cubic foot regeneration.

              <br>
              A. In our chelated resin systems, regenerant rinse water is returned 
              to the main holding tank for pH adjust and for processing through 
              the good column. We oversize our metering pumps so we can rapidly 
              adjust pH during the regeneration cycle. We also use a special program 
              which both extends the regeneration time and places time delays 
              during critical portions of the rinse cycle to allow for pH adjustment. 
              <br>
              <br>
              DI type systems either dump the water to drain or require large 
              tanks to hold the water for pH adjust and possibly further processing. 
              Even anion regenerant can have chelated metal in it and may require 
              treatment. <br>

              <br>
              A. Compact skid mounted integrated systems are designed for small 
              areas. A 15 gpm system with a 30 minute buffer tank takes an area 
              of about 5' x 8' plus 3' of access. A 25 gpm system is about 8' 
              x 12' including a plate out cell. On a gpm per square foot of floor 
              or pound of metal recovered per gpm/sq.ft, ion exchange is the most 
              cost effective waste treatment method. <br>

              </a><a name="11"><i>Q. What do I do with the regenerant? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Regenerants with heavy metals such as Copper, Nickel, Cadmium, 
              or Lead are usually electrowinned (plated out) or precipitated and 
              sludged. Anion regenerants from DI systems are usually chemically 
              treated and sludged. Cyanide effluents can be both electrowinned 
              and chemically treated to destroy the cyanide. Hexavalent Chrome 
              is chemically reduced and precipitated. Other treatment technologies 
              are possible including R.O. concentration and evaporation.<br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="12"><i>Q. How much metal is recovered in the regenerant? 
              </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Chelated resin systems in actual operation have a capacity of 
              about 1.9 pounds of Copper or 1.8 pounds of Nickel per cubic foot 
              of resin at operational pH. We have a system running on an alkaline 
              etcher rinse which may reach 20 pounds of copper per cu. ft. Capacity 
              of other metals vary with their atomic weight. In DI systems, strong 
              cation resins can hold about 0.7 times as much metal as the equivalent 
              volume of chelated resin. Anion resins have about half of the capacity 
              of cation resins. The observed capacity may differ due to several 
              factors including high levels of TDS, complexing agents, incomplete 
              regeneration, or an incomplete conversion to the sodium form during 
              the last stage of regeneration. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="13"><i>Q. What types of resins are there? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. There are many types of resins used for ion exchange purposes 
              including many specialty resins used in the lab for specific separations. 
              There are three parameters which differentiate resins, they are: 
              <br>
              1. Base polymer <br>
              2. Functional group (reactive site) <br>
              3. Size (standard vs. fine) <br>
              <br>
              Base Polymer - There are generally two types of resin bases which 
              are reacted to make ion exchange polymers. These are styrene-divinylbenzene 
              and acrylic backbones. Generally the styrene-divinylbenzene polymers 
              are the backbone for chelated resins and standard DI resins.<br>
              <br>
              Functional group - The base polymer is reacted to form a functional 
              group along the polymer. This functional group determines whether 
              a resin exchanges cations or anions, is strong or a weak resin. 
              Resins reacted to for a SO3= group are strong cation resins, a carbonate 
              group results in a weak cation resin, an iminodiacetic acid, or 
              aminophosphate reaction results in chelated cation resins. Anion 
              resins are formed by adding an amine to the resin (notice the fishy 
              amine smell on startup). Various amines form strong and weak versions 
              of the resins. <br>
              <br>
              Cation resins are resins that exchange Cations, such as Nickel, 
              Copper, Lead, Cadmium, Chrome+3, and water hardness ions (Calcium 
              and Magnesium). Anion resins exchange anions such as sulfate, formate, 
              Chloride, hexavalent Chrome, cyanide, etc. Together a strong cation 
              resin and a strong anion will deionize the water passing through 
              them. <br>
              <br>
              Strong resins hold the exchanged ion tightly and require a high 
              concentration of regenerant, about 3 times more than the theoretical 
              equivalent. This is true for both anion and cation resins. They 
              are mainly used in deionizing systems which require very pure water. 
              They show little selectivity and remove all ions that pass through 
              them. If you are not interested in DI water as a result, these resins 
              are costly to operate for just waste treatment and metal recovery. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Weak resins do not hold the exchange ions tightly and are easily 
              regenerated with a slight excess of regenerant. They generally have 
              a lower pH range with cation resins being active over a pH of 6 
              and anion resins being active at a ph under 8. Weak cation resins 
              are used in the sodium form to soften water, exchanging the sodium 
              for Calcium and Magnesium. A saturate brine solution regenerates 
              the resin. The pH limits for these resins limit their applications 
              (except for chelated resins) in waste water systems. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="14"><i>Q. What are Chelated Resins? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Chelated resins are a special catagory of weak cation resins 
              that are very useful in certain heavy metal recovery application. 
              Their pH range is lower for many heavy metals and they are selective. 
              The advantage of low pH range is that the metals do not precipitate 
              as oxides or hydroxides while you try to grab them. Precipitated 
              metals are not removed by ion exchange systems, the metals must 
              be dissolved. Selectivity is a very important feature of chelated 
              resins because it is possible to use them with ordinary city water 
              effluents and almost exclusively strip out heavy metals. While strong 
              cation resins prefer Calcium and Magnesium over Copper, Lead, Cadmium, 
              etc, the chelated resins reverse the order and pass the Calcium 
              and Magnesium at low pH and pick up the heavy metals. <br>

              </a><a name="15"><i>Q. How long does a regeneration take? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Depending on the size of the system, from 1.5 to 5 hours. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="16"><i>Q. Do I have to shut down for regeneration? 
              </i><br>
              <br>
              A. No. Regeneration is automatic and the system isolates the column 
              to be regenerated and runs the effluent through the other column. 
              If you let both columns breakthrough, you will have to shut down 
              but somebody was asleep to let both columns breakthrough. I'll bet 
              you won't let it happen again. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="17"><i>Q. Do I have to pH adjust before the ion exchange 
              system? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. No, unless your stream is very low in pH and the hydraulic capacity 
              of the system is very close to your flow rate. We use in-line pH 
              sensors and large metering pumps to insure rapid on-line pH adjustments 
              but very low pH effluent (less than 2.0) require some pH adjust 
              time and if there is no excess hydraulic capacity, you must pre-adjust 
              pH. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="18"><i>Q. How automatic is automatic? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Full automatic controls are available including sensors to determine 
              the level in the dosing tanks, no flow alarms, regenerant sensing, 
              and breakthrough detection. Full data monitoring, storage and analysis 
              is available as are network interfaces. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="19"><i>Q. What is leakage? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Resins are not 100% efficient and as the concentration of ions 
              gets low, some can slip past the resin and &quot;leak&quot;. Leakage 
              is constant until breakthrough. Usually the leakage is much lower 
              than 0.5 ppm until the column is almost spent. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="20"><i>Q. What is breakthrough?</i><br>
              <br>
              A. When the resin column becomes saturated with ions and the capacity 
              is almost all used up, leakage increases until the concentration 
              of ions in equals the concentration out. When the leakage starts 
              to increase rapidly, indicating the end of the useful life of the 
              column, breakthrough is said to occur. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="21"><i>Q. Do I have to segregate effluent lines? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Maybe. Resins systems vary with their tolerances but as a general 
              rule, some segregation will make your life easier. The key thing 
              to watch for is streams with high particulate levels that may cause 
              rapid plugging of the filter, organic solvents that may attack the 
              elastomer or piping parts of the system, or in the case of DI type 
              systems, any organics that may attack the anion resin. For clear 
              metal streams that do not settle out when you let it stand overnight, 
              no segregation is probably needed. We will evaluate each stream 
              in you facility and advise you how it should be treated. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="22"><i>Q. What types of problems will I have? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. The main problem we see is plugging. Usually some one dumps something 
              in a rinse tank to get rid of it and it sludges out and plugs up 
              the sand filter. Sometimes the pumps will clog instead. The kinds 
              of thing that have caused problems for our customers are: <br>
              Cement Sand (from an unprotected sump)<br>
              Photoresist waste (organic goo)<br>
              Screen ink waste (more organic goo)<br>
              Mop head strings (dumping floor waste through the system)<br>
              Pencil ends, nuts and bolts in pump<br>
              Precipitated Tin Oxide (white sludge)<br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="23"><i>Q. What do I do with the regenerant? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. There are several choices, evaporation, precipitation, electrowinning 
              (metals), hauling and/or combining with other recycle materials. 
              The proper choice depends on the frequence of regeneration and the 
              size of the batch. Recovery may not be econominical for very small 
              facilites, electrowinning or evaporation may not be practical or 
              the best choice in some applications. In certain applications, the 
              regenerant may be in a useable form which allows close to 100% recycling. 
              <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="24"><i>Q. What is electrowinning? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Electrowinning is plating the metal onto a cathode (plate) using 
              a direct current rectifier. Metals such as Copper, Nickel and Cadmium 
              can be recovered by introducing a direct current between and anode 
              (positive charge) and a cathode (negative charge). Anodes and cathodes 
              are usually flat plates. Anode materials vary with the solution 
              chemistry. Cathode materials are usually stainless steel or Copper.

              </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Evaporation is an expensive way to concentrate solutions unless 
              there is a lot of waste heat available. Regenerants can usually 
              be plated out much faster than they can be evaporated. Evaporation 
              is best for special applications where the recovered salt has a 
              very high value or can be directly reused. <br>

              </a><a name="26"><i>Q. Should I evaporate to go to Zero Discharge? 
              </i><br>
              <br>
              A. The only way to truly get to zero discharge is to evaporate the 
              DI regenerant and/or RO reject from a recycling system. The operating 
              cost of this is usually quite high and the benefit questionable 
              unless you have very special circumstances such as no POTW and a 
              ground discharge. The only easy call for evaporation is if your 
              discharge requirement is so low and your water allocation so small 
              that you cannot operate and stay in compliance. <br>

              </a><a name="27"><i>Q. Should I use dragouts to reduce metal concentrations 
              in the rinses? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Dragouts reduce the metal levels in the following rinse, but 
              unless the solution you are concentrating is valuable or can be 
              added back into the process tank directly, a dragout is not necessary 
              for an ion exchange system. A dragout usually does not get concentrated 
              enough to electrowinn directly so you would probably bleed it into 
              the ion exchange system with the rinsewater. The only other reason 
              for a dragout when using ion exchange to capture metals is if you 
              have a strict water conservation program and wish the following 
              rinse to remain very clean with low water flow. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="28"><i>Q.What kind of filtration is necessary? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. Ion exchange systems remove ions in solution. Anything not in 
              solution and anything in solution that is not ionic (alcohols such 
              a isopropyl and glycols, surfactants, etc.) is not removed. Particulate 
              materials such as flux residues, solder balls, photoresist chips, 
              pencils, etc need to be removed before the ion exchange system. 
              Many types of filtration have been tried and many have failed. Cartridge 
              and other fixed media filters that you change out and dispose of 
              tend to have very short lives in waste water treatment application. 
              These generally require much maintenance and few still survive on 
              existing systems. A media or sand filter is easily cleaned and there 
              are no consumables to change. <br>
              <br>
              </a><a name="29"><i>Q.What does a sand/media filter do? </i><br>
              <br>
              A. We use a sand type filter to remove particulates that may clog 
              the resin bed. The sand filter is easier to clean up than the resin 
              bed. Resin beads have very small holes which are difficult to clean 
              if fine particulates enter the bed. Cleaning a sand filter is much 
              easier than cleaning a resin bed. <br>

              <br>
              A. Carbon is derived from either wood or coal. The starting material 
              is heated in an inert atmosphere to convert it to pure carbon. The 
              way it is processed results in a very high surface area and an ability 
              to adsorb various material. The capacity for both organic and inorganic 
              materials is high but carbon is usually used for adsorbing organics. 
              Each organic and each type of carbon have a different adsorption 
              capacity. <br>
              Carbon is used to adsorb organics, chromates, sulfides and chlorine. 
              It is used to prevent strong oxidizing materials, such as peroxides, 
              nitric acid, and chlorine, from attacking ion exchange resins and 
              it is used as a general adsorbent in recycling systems. <br>

              <br>
              A. DI resins usually many years. Some of the resin beads break during 
              the swell cycle when regenerating. The life is partially dependent 
              on the number of regenerations and partially on the quantity of 
              oxidizers passed through the column. <br>

              A. Only if you totally destroy the resin should you change it out 
              and haul it away. Usually a little bit is lost each regeneration 
              (due to breakage) and each year you will top up the columns with 
              10% or so. The resin should last a long time if the system is run 
              correctly. Following the manufacturers segregation suggestions will 
              help increase resin life. <br>

              <br>
              A. Systems are sized on flow and recovery requirements. When you 
              provide flow data for each type of rinse stream with a general analysis 
              of the level of contamination, it is relatively easy to calculate 
              the size of the system required. If you are presently running a 
              50 gpm sludging system, your probably can get by with a 20-25 gpm 
              metal recovery system. Some examples are shown below. <br>
              <br>
              Example 1: a system requiring a recovery of 20 pounds per day of 
              copper and having a segregated rinse flow rate of 22 gpm peak for 
              4 hours maximum. <br>
              Using a chelated resin at 1 gpm per cubic foot of resin would be 
              22 cu. ft. of resin nominal which would be rounded up to a 25 gpm 
              system (with only 4 hours peak flow, a 20 gpm system may be enough). 
              <br>
              <br>
              The resin would be in 2 columns of 12.5 cu. feet each. Each column 
              would hold 1.9 pounds of copper per cu.ft or 23.75 pounds per regeneration. 
              You would have to regenerate once per day. A 20 cubic foot system 
              would be to small. In this case, you would look for the source of 
              copper and reduce it if possible. <br>
              <br>
              Example 2: A small facility has a nickel sulfamate plating bath. 
              Flow peaks at 4 gpm for no more than 5 minutes, twice an hour. Average 
              flow is 120 gallons per hour. Nickel levels range up to 20 ppm maximum. 
              What size system would be required? <br>
              A 2 gpm system would be enough. Using the maximum Nickel concentration 
              times the average flow, we get 2.4 grams of nickel per hour. On 
              a 8 hour shift, about 19.2 grams. One shift per day, is 134 grams 
              per week. About three weeks to get a pound and for a one cubic foot 
              chelate resin column, it would take about 5 and one half weeks for 
              breakthrough. </a><a name="33"></a><a name="33"></a></font></p>
