            <div align="left">
<p><tt><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. The 
                Skid - Remco ion exchange and deionization systems are assembled 
                on a fiberglass skid fabricated by Remco Engineering and bonded 
                with structural epoxy. The skid is coated with a chemical resistant 
                epoxy. Single skids up to 10' X 12' are used for 90 gpm systems 
                or smaller. Larger systems use multiple skids. <br>
                <br>
                2. The Buffer Tank - Mounted on the skid is the main buffer tank 
                which is sized for a 20 minute retention time. Our buffer tanks 
                are constructed of fiberglass using isopthalic ester resin with 
                a vinyl ester resin interior gel coat (100 mils thick). Each fiberglass 
                tank has either a full or half hinged lid. The main level controls, 
                diverter valve assembly, air agitation assembly and all of the 
                feed lines are mounted on the lid. <br>
                <br>
                3. pH Control System - Remco Engineering supplies a dual high/low 
                pH adjust system. Both a pump bypass to the main buffer tank and 
                an air agitation system mix the solution entering the tank. pH 
                adjust additions are injected in the return line to the pH adjust 
                tank to insure rapid mixing. Oversized metering pumps insure rapid 
                adjustment to 0.2 pH. The pH control systems are enclosed in a 
                Nema 4x housing keeping in line with our basic policy of utilizing 
                corrosion resistant construction materials. To decrease wear on 
                the controller relays, separate replaceable relays operate the 
                metering pumps. Interlocks are provided to the main program controller 
                to insure no solution flows when the system is out of the desired 
                pH range. <br>
                <br>
                4. Pumping system - Dual centrifugal pumps are used to provide 
                a backup and keep downtime to a minimum. The pumps are mounted 
                on the skid and controlled from the main electrical control panel 
                with an A/B switch. Each pump has it own motor contactor. The 
                pumps have their own circuit on a separate circuit breaker in 
                the main panel. One of the pumps is on all of the time. When solution 
                is not being feed through the resin columns, the solution is recirculated 
                back to the pH adjust tank to increase the mixing efficiency. 
                The recirculation loop is controlled by both the pH controller 
                as described above and by the level control. The level control 
                is a three probe conductivity type system working in a pump-down 
                mode. The system is set up so approximately 15-20% of the solution 
                is left in the tank as a recirculation buffer. When the solution 
                is raised to the upper level probe, the system starts the pump 
                down mode that continues until the low level probe is reached 
                or the pH is out of the set point range for the pH controller. 
                <br>
                <br>
                5. The diverter valve assembly - We use modular construction techniques 
                as much as we can to insure that we can build and sell our systems 
                at a reasonable cost. Our diverter valve (valve stack) assembly 
                is a good illustration of this philosophy. Most of the valves 
                to control the flow through the system are assembled in one unit 
                that is mounted in the skid just before the interconnecting plumbing 
                is started. The valves are air operated so it takes little time 
                to hook up the air lines and it is easy to check and see if they 
                are operational. <br>
                <br>
                6. Media filter - Each system has an oversized media filter constructed 
                of thermo-wound fiberglass with a rating of at least twice the 
                nominal flow rate. The media filter is large enough and fine enough 
                to catch any material which could plug the resin columns. There 
                is a manually initiated, timed backwash function which cleans 
                the filter in about 10 minutes. The backwashed material is captured 
                in a bag filter constructed of stainless steel. The media filter 
                is activated by a pushbutton on the main control panel and the 
                time for backwashing is controlled by the main programmable controller. 
                Dual filter configurations are automatically controlled by the 
                microprocessor controller on a timed cycle. The manual backwash 
                initiation is still available but not normally needed. <br>
                <br>
                7. Ion exchange columns. - Our columns are constructed of fiberglass 
                on systems up to 80 gpm. We use a lead/lag system where the lead 
                (first) column is regenerated when it is full of metal and the 
                lag (second) column is used exclusively during regeneration and 
                becomes the lead column after regeneration. The system stays on 
                line during the regeneration phase. At least half of the systems 
                resin is always on stream. The system is designed for one gallon 
                per minute per cubic foot of resin. This is a conservative design 
                flow rate. Even when operating on only one half of the systems' 
                resin during the regeneration cycle, the effluent metal levels 
                are very low. Copper systems usually run under 0.5 ppm and can 
                run under 0.05 ppm, depending on how full the columns get between 
                regenerations and how closely the system is monitored.<br>
                <br>
                8. Ion exchange resins - Many different resins are available from 
                many different manufacturers. There is no such thing as a metal 
                specific resin although many are better for some metals than others. 
                We use resins that maximize the efficiency of the system for the 
                particular metal of interest. Please seek a quotation if you wish 
                a better definition of a resin for your particular situation. 
                <br>
                <br>
                9. Control System - Our system uses a microprocessor to control 
                the valves and interlocks. The control system is mounted in a 
                Nema 4x fiberglass enclosure. We feature all air operated valves 
                controlled by manifolded solenoid valves mounted in the main control 
                panel. The main control panel also houses the level control board, 
                circuit breakers, power latching relay, and all motor controllers. 
                Our system features fully automatic <b>and</b> manual control 
                of the regeneration cycle. Optional systems can fully automate 
                the process where an operator is called if needed. Our systems 
                are computer capable featuring RS232 porting. <br>
                <br>
                10. Regeneration - Regeneration is initiated with one button as 
                is backwashing the media filter. Once the regenerant tanks are 
                full, select either backwash column A or column B with the front 
                pushbutton and then let the system work. Three to four hours later, 
                depending on the system capacity, the system automatically returns 
                to the correct state. One column is always on line during regeneration. 
                No further operator intervention is required. After regeneration, 
                a valve is opened and the regenerant pump is turned on from the 
                main control panel; the regenerant tank is emptied to the reclaim 
                module for metal reclamation. When the metal is plated out to 
                a low level, the recovered acid is pumped back into the regeneration 
                tank from the control panel of the reclaim module. See our <a href="ix-procs.htm">Metal 
                Recover Ion Exchange Process</a> literature for details on the 
                chemistry of MRIX systems or the <a href="di.htm">Deionization</a> 
                literature for details on the DI process in general . <br>
                <br>
                11. Regeneration Modules - Regeneration modules consist of a tank 
                for regenerant, a centrifugal pump, diverter valves for draining 
                and cleaning, and a manual override on the main control panels. 
                There are usually two regeneration modules on larger systems, 
                smaller systems use an eductor for caustic which is fed from a 
                55 gallon drum. One is for the acid regenerant which recovers 
                cation metals, the other is for caustic which prepares the resin 
                for the next cycle. Our regenerant tanks are constructed of polypropylene 
                and reinforced where necessary. Each is sized to handle the proper 
                concentration and amount of regenerant. No molded polyethylene 
                tanks are ever used . Regenerant recovery is important to us so 
                our systems are designed to remove as much undiluted regenerant 
                as possible before rinsing the system. Our resin columns are &quot;blown 
                down&quot; with air before and after each rinse to increase the 
                effectiveness of each step in the process and to minimize water 
                usage. Our acid regeneration modules fill up to within 1/4&quot; 
                of the initial level after the regenerant is recovered. To reclaim 
                a regenerant, it is pumped to a recovery module where the metals 
                are plated out. <br>
                <br>
                12. Recovery Modules - Each recovery module consists of a tank 
                constructed of polypropylene with appropriate girthing. Each unit 
                is self contained and mounted on a separate skid. The units include 
                the main tank sized at 2 times the volume of the regeneration 
                module on the main skid, a recirculation pump, motor controller 
                with housing, and a electrolytic cell. Each cell has multiple 
                anodes on close centers for high transfer efficiencies. Low current 
                densities allow efficient plating down to reasonably low metal 
                levels. Each electrowinning cell has between 18 to 44 square feet 
                of cathode area available. Multiple cell systems are available. 
                The same units can be used for cyanide destruct or for electroless 
                recovery or chelate destruct. Rectifiers supplied with self contained 
                recovery units are mounted on the same skid. </font></tt></p>
