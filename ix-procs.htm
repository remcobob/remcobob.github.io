                Remco Metal Recovery Ion Exchange (MRIX) process is unique in 
                that all of our skid mounted systems are complete water treatment 
                units featuring microprocessor control, very low water use, complete 
                prefiltration and VERY efficient regenerant usage. We will describe 
                the metal recovery ion exchange process in detail starting with 
                your feed to the system (you can pump or we can pull using a Remco 
                Engineering Sumpless Pump).<br>
                <br>
                The Metal Recovery Process<img src="chin1b.jpg" width="367" height="291" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"><br>
                Rinse water is collected from your process and held in the main 
                buffer tank which is included with all systems. This tank is sized 
                for 20-60 minute retention. It serves as a buffer when the flow 
                exceeds the design flow rate and also allows service or maintenance 
                without interrupting production. Here the waste stream is pH adjusted 
                to the optimum required by the ion exchange resin. The water is 
                then transferred through a media pre-filter where sediment is 
                removed. This transfer is accomplished with a two stage level 
                controller that is interfaced with the pH controller. In operation 
                the tank must be at the upper level control point and at the correct 
                pH before the system goes on line (pumps through columns). The 
                system stays on line until the tank reaches a second (lower) level 
                indicator. This mechanism assures us of always having a buffering 
                action that accommodates a varying incoming pH while delivering 
                a very stable pH to the ion exchange resin columns. Our system 
                utilizes duplex feed pumps, reserving one pump for standby operation. 
                With this arrangement, down time is kept at a minimum. <br>
                <br>
                The media filter is a column of sand like material (Aluminum silicate) 
                that works as a depth filter. The more it is run, the finer it 
                filters. When flow drops below the design flow rate, the filter 
                is backwashed into a bag filter with the separated liquid being 
                returned to the buffer tank. The contents of this sediment is 
                entirely dependent on what debris may be going down the drains. 
                Any dissolved metal contained in the liquid portion of the backwash 
                is pH adjusted and processed back through the system. NOTHING 
                GOES TO DRAIN WITHOUT PASSING THROUGH THE COLUMNS.<br>
                <br>
                From the media filter the filtered metal bearing water is directed 
                through the top of the first column of ion exchange resin out 
                the bottom and into the top of the second column. From here it 
                is discharged to the sewer. This configuration is referred to 
                as lead/lag. Their respective positions to the flow of the rinse 
                waters changes during the regeneration operation. It is in these 
                columns where the metal ions are exchanged and captured on the 
                exchange sites of the resin. <br>
                <br>
                The ion exchange resin used varies with the application but for 
                this example we use a weak acid chelated resin, used for Copper, 
                Nickel, and Lead recovery. This resin is used in the sodium form. 
                A metal ion is exchanged for a sodium ion in a similar fashion 
                to a home water softener. For example, a Copper ion is captured 
                when it passes through the column and is exchanged for two Sodium 
                This is because the chemical valence of Copper is 2, Sodium 1, 
                therefore, 1 Copper = 2 Sodium when exchanged. As you can see, 
                we are not de-ionizing (DI) the water but exchanging one ion (ion 
                exchange) for another. The advantage of this process is that you 
                only capture what you need to remove from solution and not what 
                you are permitted to let pass.<br>
                <br>
                As the ion exchange exchange process continues, the resin slowly 
                fills up with metal. The point at which regeneration is required 
                is determined by monitoring the stream after is has passed through 
                the lead (first) column and before is reaches the lag (second) 
                column. Rising metal levels here indicate the lead column is exhausted 
                and requires regeneration. The operator pushes a button which 
                initiates the microprocessor to begin the regeneration cycle. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The complete cycle is simple to describe, but involves a number 
                of valves, timed cycles, and switching. Rather than depend on 
                manual operation and the possibility of error, a microprocessor 
                assures you of proper functioning and very low levels of metal 
                in the effluent.<br>
                <br>
                When the regeneration cycle is initiated, the lead column is taken 
                off line while the following (lag) column with its available exchange 
                sites is maintained on line to process the wastewater. The lead 
                column is then reverse rinsed from bottom to top with water. The 
                water is returned to the the holding/pH adjust tank. <br>
                <br>
                Next, the column is backwashed with of 8-15 % acid solution. The 
                acid backwash supplies hydrogen ions which exchange with the metal 
                ions on the resin. The resin cannot hold on to the metals at low 
                pH. The metal ions and the acid are returned to the acid holding 
                tank as metal salt. This is approximately 10 gallons of solution 
                per cubic foot of resin. <br>
                <br>
                The column is then rinsed with fresh water with the rinse diverted 
                to the head of the system as it contains some metal and will require 
                pH adjustment and polishing for metal removal. After the thorough 
                fresh water rinse, a solution of 5% sodium hydroxide is passed 
                through the column. This replaces the hydrogen ions on the resin 
                with Sodium.and prepares the column for operation. If the column 
                were left in the hydrogen form, every time a metal ion came by, 
                it would be exchanged for the Hydrogen ion. This would lower the 
                pH locally and cause another metal ion to be released, this would 
                cause the metal to pass through the column (not good). <br>
                <br>
                The column is backwashed again to remove the excess caustic and 
                this rinse water, as with the others, is diverted to the head 
                of the system for reprocessing. The entire regeneration cycle 
                takes about 3-5 hours depending on the system size and customer 
                requirements. <br>
                <br>
                The regenerated column is placed back on line in the lag position. 
                The column that was previously second is now lead. The clean column 
                is always second in line. By testing and regenerating when levels 
                rise between the columns we are always assured of very low metal 
                concentration in the effluent because the waste stream still has 
                to pass through a column with available exchange sites. <br>
                <br>
                There are several methods for recovering the metal from the regenerant 
                solution. One is to collect the metal as a salt by evaporation. 
                Some salts such as the Sodium forms of Cyanide and Chromium or 
                the Sulfate or Chloride salts of Copper and Nickel have a slight 
                value which allow for reclamation at minimal costs.</tt></font></p>
