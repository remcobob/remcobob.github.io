Blood Pressure</a></span></p>

<p class=tni><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The most
comprehensive and systematic analysis of the causes of death ever undertaken
was published recently in the <span class=epub-i1>Lancet</span>, one of the
world’s leading medical journals.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-1" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-1>1</a></span>
Funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Burden of Disease
Study involved nearly five hundred researchers from more than three hundred
institutions in fifty countries and examined nearly one hundred thousand data
sources.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-2"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-2>2</a></span> The results allow us to answer such
questions as “How many lives could we save if people around the world cut back
on soda?” The best answer? 299,521.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-3" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-3>3</a></span> So
soft drinks and their empty calories don’t just fail to promote health—they
actually seem to promote death. But apparently soda isn’t nearly as deadly as
bacon, bologna, ham, and hot dogs. Processed meat is blamed for the deaths of
more than eight hundred thousand people every year. Worldwide, that’s four
times more people than who die from illicit drug use.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-4" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-4>4</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The study also noted
which foods, if added to the diet, might <span class=epub-i1>save</span> lives.
Eating more whole grains could potentially save 1.7 million lives a year. More
vegetables? 1.8 million lives. How about nuts and seeds? 2.5 million lives. The
researchers didn’t look at beans, but of the foods they considered, which does
the world need most? Fruit. Worldwide, if humanity ate more fruit, we might
save 4.9 million lives. That’s nearly 5 million lives hanging in the balance,
and their salvation isn’t medication or a new vaccine—it may be just more fruit.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-5" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-5>5</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The number-one risk
factor for death in the world they identified is high blood pressure.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-6" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-6>6</a></span> Also known as hypertension, high blood pressure lays
waste to nine million people worldwide every year.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-7" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-7>7</a></span> It
kills so many people because it contributes to deaths from a variety of causes,
including aneurysms, heart attacks, heart failure, kidney failure, and stroke.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>You’ve probably had
your blood pressure taken at the doctor’s office. The nurse reads off two
numbers, say, for example, “115 over 75.” The first number (“systolic”)
represents the pressure in your arteries as your blood pumps from the heart;
the second number (“diastolic”) is the pressure in your arteries while the
heart is resting between beats. The American Heart Association defines “normal”
blood pressure as a systolic pressure under 120 and a diastolic pressure under
80—or 120/80. Anything above 140/90 is considered hypertensive. Values in
between are considered prehypertensive.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-8" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-8>8</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Increased blood
pressure puts a strain on the heart and can damage the sensitive blood vessels
in your eyes and kidneys, cause bleeding in the brain, and even lead certain
arteries to balloon and rupture. The fact that hypertension can damage so many
organ systems and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, two of our leading
killers, explains why it is the number-one killer risk factor worldwide.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In the United States,
nearly seventy-eight million people have high blood pressure—that’s about one
in three American adults.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-9" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-9>9</a></span> As
you age, your blood pressure tends to get higher and higher. In fact, after age
sixty, 65 percent of Americans can expect to be diagnosed with the condition.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-10" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-10>10</a></span> This has led many people, including doctors, to assume
that high blood pressure, like wrinkles or gray hair, is just an inevitable
consequence of getting older. However, we’ve known for nearly a century that
this isn’t true.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In the 1920s,
researchers measured the blood pressure of a thousand native Kenyans who ate a
low-sodium diet centered around whole plant foods—whole grains, beans, fruits,
and dark, leafy greens, and other vegetables.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-11" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-11>11</a></span> Up
until age forty, the blood pressure of the rural Africans was similar to that
of Europeans and Americans, about 125/80. However, as Westerners aged, their
blood pressure began to surge past the Kenyans. By age sixty, the average
Westerner was hypertensive, with blood pressure exceeding 140/90. What about
the Kenyans? By age sixty, their average blood pressure had actually <span
class=epub-i1>improved</span> to an average of about 110/70<span class=epub-i1>.</span><span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-12" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-12>12</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The 140/90 threshold
for hypertension is considered an arbitrary cutoff.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-13" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-13>13</a></span>
Just like having too much cholesterol or body fat, there are benefits to having
a blood pressure that is even lower than the “normal” range. So even people who
start out with a so-called normal blood pressure of 120/80 appear to benefit
from going down to 110/70.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-14" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-14>14</a></span>
But is it possible to do that? Look at the Kenyans—not only is it possible, it
appears <span class=epub-i1>typical</span> for people who live healthy,
plant-based lifestyles.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Over a two-year
period, 1,800 patients were admitted into a rural Kenyan hospital. How many
cases of high blood pressure did they find? Zero. There also wasn’t a single
case found of America’s number-one killer, atherosclerosis.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-15" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-15>15</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>High blood pressure,
then, appears to be a choice. You can continue eating the artery-bursting
Western diet, or you can choose to take off the pressure. The truth is that
eliminating humanity’s primary risk factor for death may be simple. No drugs,
no scalpels. Just forks.</span></p>

<p class=h align=center style='text-align:center'><span class=epub-b1><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Sodium</span></span></p>

<p class=tni><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The two most
prominent dietary risks for death and disability in the world may be not eating
enough fruit and eating too much salt. Nearly five million people appear to die
every year as a result of not eating enough fruit,<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-16" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-16>16</a></span>
while eating too much salt may kill up to four million.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-17" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-17>17</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Salt is a compound
made up of about 40 percent sodium and 60 percent chloride. Sodium is an
essential nutrient, but vegetables and other natural foods provide the small
amounts of sodium you need in your diet. If you consume too much, it can cause
water retention, and your body may respond by raising your blood pressure to
push the excess fluid and salt out of your system.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-18" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-18>18</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>For the first 90
percent of human evolution, we likely ate diets containing less than the
equivalent of a quarter teaspoon of salt’s worth of sodium a day.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-19" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-19>19</a></span> Why? Because we likely ate mostly plants.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-20" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-20>20</a></span> We went millions of years without saltshakers, so our
bodies evolved into sodium-conserving machines. That served us well until we
discovered that salt could be used to preserve foods.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-21" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-21>21</a></span>
Without refrigeration, this was a boon to human civilization. It didn’t matter
that the addition of salt to our food resulted in a general rise in blood
pressure—the alternative was starving to death because all our food rotted
away.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>But where does that
leave us now? After all, we no longer have to live off pickles and jerky.
Humans are genetically programmed to eat ten times less sodium than we do now.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-22" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-22>22</a></span> Many so-called low-salt diets can actually be
considered high-salt diets. That’s why it’s critical to understand what the
concept of “normal” is when it comes to sodium. Having a “normal” salt intake
can lead to a “normal” blood pressure, which can contribute to us dying from
all the “normal” causes, like heart attacks and strokes.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-23" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-23>23</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The American Heart
Association recommends everyone consume less than 1,500 mg of sodium daily<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-24" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-24>24</a></span>—that’s about three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. The
average American adult consumes more than double that amount, about 3,500 mg
daily.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-25"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-25>25</a></span> Reducing sodium consumption by just
15 percent worldwide could save millions of lives every year.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-26" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-26>26</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>If we could cut our
salt intake by about a half teaspoon a day, which is achievable by avoiding
salty foods and not adding salt to our food, we might prevent 22 percent of
stroke deaths and 16 percent of fatal heart attacks. That’s potentially more
lives saved than if we were able to successfully treat people with blood
pressure pills.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-27"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-27>27</a></span> Simply put, reducing salt is an
easy at-home intervention that may be more powerful than filling a prescription
from the pharmacy. Up to ninety-two thousand American lives could be saved each
year simply by eating less salt.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-28" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-28>28</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The evidence that
sodium raises blood pressure is clear, including double-blind, randomized
trials dating back decades.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-29" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-29>29</a></span> If
we take subjects with high blood pressure and put them on a sodium-restricted
diet, their blood pressure drops. If we keep them on the low-salt diet and add
a placebo, nothing happens. However, if we instead give subjects salt in the
form of a time-release sodium pill, their blood pressure goes back up again.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-30" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-30>30</a></span> The more sodium we give them secretly, the higher their
blood pressure climbs.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-31" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-31>31</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Even just a single
meal can do it. If we take people with normal blood pressure and give them a
bowl of soup containing the amount of salt that may be found in an average
American meal,<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-32"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-32>32</a></span> their blood pressure climbs over
the next three hours compared to eating the same soup without any added salt.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-33" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-33>33</a></span> Dozens of similar studies demonstrate that if you
reduce your salt intake, you reduce your blood pressure. And the greater the
reduction, the greater the benefit. But if you don’t cut down, chronic high salt
intake can lead to a gradual increase in blood pressure throughout life.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-34" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-34>34</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Doctors used to be
taught that a “normal” systolic blood pressure is approximately 100 plus age.
Indeed that’s about what you’re born with. Babies start out with a blood
pressure around 95/60. But, as you age, that 95 can go up to 120 by your
twenties. By the time you’re in your forties, it can be up to 140—the official
cutoff for high blood pressure—and then keep climbing as you get older.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-35" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-35>35</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>What would happen if,
instead of consuming ten times more sodium than what your bodies were designed
to handle, you just ate the natural amount found in whole foods? Is it possible
your blood pressure would stay low your whole life? To test that theory, we’d
have to find a population in modern times that doesn’t use salt, eat processed
food, or go out to eat. To find a no-salt culture, scientists had to go deep
into the Amazon rainforest.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-36" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-36>36</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Strangers to
saltshakers, Cheetos, and KFC, the Yanomamo Indians were found to have the
lowest sodium intake ever recorded—which is to say the sodium intake we evolved
eating.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-37"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-37>37</a></span> Lo and behold, researchers found
that the blood pressures among older Yanomamo were the same as those of
adolescents.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-38"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-38>38</a></span> In other words, they start out with
an average blood pressure of about 100/60 and stay that way for life. The
researchers couldn’t find a single case of high blood pressure.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-39" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-39>39</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Why do we suspect it
was the sodium? After all, the Yanomamos studied didn’t drink alcohol, ate a
high-fiber, plant-based diet, had lots of exercise, and were not obese.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-40" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-40>40</a></span> An interventional trial could prove that sodium was the
culprit. Imagine if we took people literally dying from out-of-control high
blood pressure (known as malignant hypertension), a condition from which you go
blind from bleeding into your eyes, your kidneys shut down, and your heart eventually
fails. What if you put these patients on a Yanomamo-level salt intake—in other
words, a normal-for-the-human-species salt intake?</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Enter Dr. Walter
Kempner and his rice-and-fruit diet. Without drugs, he brought patients with
eye-popping blood pressures like 240/150 down to 105/80 with dietary changes
alone. How could he ethically withhold medication from such seriously ill
patients? Modern high-blood-pressure pills hadn’t been invented yet—Dr. Kempner
conducted his work back in the 1940s.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-41" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-41>41</a></span>
Back then, malignant hypertension was a death sentence, with a life expectancy
of about six months.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-42"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-42>42</a></span> Nevertheless, he was able to
reverse the course of disease with diet in more than 70 percent of cases.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-43" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-43>43</a></span> Though the diet wasn’t merely extremely low sodium—it
was also strictly plant-based and low in fat and protein—Dr. Kempner is now
recognized as the person who established, beyond any shadow of doubt, that high
blood pressure can often be lowered by a low-sodium diet.<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-44" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-44>44</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In addition to high
blood pressure, salty meals can significantly impair artery function,<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-45" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-45>45</a></span> even among people whose blood pressure tends to be
unresponsive to salt intake.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-46" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-46>46</a></span> In
other words, salt itself can injure our arteries independent of its impact on
blood pressure. And that harm begins within thirty minutes.<span

id=cha-47>47</a></span></span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Using a technique
called laser Doppler flowmetry, researchers are able to measure blood flow in
the tiny vessels in the skin. After a high-sodium meal, there is significantly
less blood flow—unless vitamin C is injected into the skin, which appears to
reverse much of the sodium-induced suppression of blood vessel function. So, if
an antioxidant helps block the sodium effect, then the mechanism by which salt
impairs arterial function may be oxidative stress, the formation of free
radicals in your bloodstream.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-48" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-48>48</a></span> It
turns out that sodium intake appears to suppress the activity of a key
antioxidant enzyme in the body called superoxide dismutase,<span
class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-49" epub:type="noteref"
id=cha-49>49</a></span> which has the ability to detoxify a million free
radicals per second.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-50"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-50>50</a></span> With the action of this workhorse
of an enzyme stifled by sodium, artery-crippling levels of oxidative stress can
build up.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>After one salty meal,
not only does blood pressure increase but the arteries actually begin to
stiffen.<span class=epub-sup-fn><a href="part0053.html#chapter7-51"
epub:type="noteref" id=cha-51>51</a></span> This may be how we figured out
thousands of years ago that too much salt was bad for us. Quoting from a
translation of <span class=epub-i1>The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal
Medicine</span>, an ancient Chinese medical text, “If too much salt is used in
food, the pulse hardens…”<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-52" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-52>52</a></span> It
turns out that we may not need a double-blind trial; maybe we just have to feed
someone a bag of potato chips and take his or her pulse.</span></p>

<p class=tx><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Unsurprisingly, the
salt industry isn’t thrilled about the idea of us cutting back on salt. Back in
2009, the American Heart Association quoted the chair of the U.S. Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee as saying that Americans should reduce their
sodium intake. The Salt Institute, a salt industry trade organization, accused
her of having an “unhealthy prejudice” against salt, arguing that she had
“pre-judged the salt issue.”<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-53" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-53>53</a></span>
This is like the tobacco industry complaining that people at the American Lung
Association are biased against smoking. Of course, the Salt Institute wasn’t
the only aggrieved party. Cheese, it turns out, ranks as a leading contributor
of sodium in the American diet,<span class=epub-sup-fn><a
href="part0053.html#chapter7-54" epub:type="noteref" id=cha-54>54</a></span>
and the National Dairy Council stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Big Salt in its
condemnation of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommendations.<span
